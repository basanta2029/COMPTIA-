11.3.2 Automation and Scripting Facts

Automation and orchestration are powerful tools for managing security operations. Automation uses software to perform repetitive, rule-based tasks, such as monitoring for threats, applying patches, maintaining baselines, or responding to incidents, to improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of human error. Orchestration enhances automation by coordinating and streamlining the interactions between automated processes and systems. Orchestration supports seamless and integrated workflows, especially in large, complex environments with many different security tools and systems. Automation and orchestration also provide clear audit trails supporting regulatory compliance and incident investigation. While their implementation comes with challenges such as complexity, cost, and the potential for a single point of failure, careful management of these tools can greatly improve an organization's security posture.
Benefits of Infrastructure Management Automation

Automating and orchestrating infrastructure configurations introduces numerous benefits. Enforcing standardized configurations ensures consistency and accuracy throughout the infrastructure. Automation saves time and resources by allowing configurations to be quickly deployed, and it also enhances scalability and flexibility by simplifying the deployment and configuration of new resources.

Furthermore, automation and orchestration improve standardization, compliance, and change management by enforcing predefined configuration standards, making auditing and change tracking easier, and controlling configuration drift. Additionally, automation can strengthen security and governance by enforcing security controls, applying patches consistently, and automating security-related tasks.

Automation and Scripting

Automation and scripting have emerged as critical tools in modern IT operations, helping organizations streamline processes, enhance security, and improve efficiency. Automation serves as a tool to enhance both security governance and change management. In terms of governance, automation can help enforce security policies more consistently and efficiently, and it can aid in monitoring and reporting to provide valuable insights for leadership teams and risk managers. In change management, automation can reduce the risk of human error, reduce implementation time, and provide clear audit trails. For example, scripts are effective for applying patches and updates across an organization's systems uniformly, and automation tools can track these changes for later review.
Benefits of Automation and Orchestration in Security Operations

Automation and orchestration also offer many important benefits to security operations. Primarily, they enhance efficiency by enabling repetitive tasks to be performed quickly and consistently, reducing the burden on security teams and minimizing the likelihood of human error (sometimes referred to as a  workforce multiplier).

Operator fatigue refers to the mental exhaustion experienced by cybersecurity professionals due to their work's continuous, high-intensity nature. Security analysts must monitor numerous systems for potential threats, manage high volumes of alerts (including many false positives,) and respond to confirmed threats as quickly as possible. These working conditions often lead to long hours, anxiety, and elevated stress levels, resulting in operator fatigue. This fatigue is a significant concern in cybersecurity because it can lead to decreased alertness and cognitive function and impair the ability of security personnel to identify and respond to threats effectively. Fatigue results in missed critical alerts, slower response times, and a greater likelihood of errors, any of which can compromise security.

Automation and orchestration play crucial roles in combating operator fatigue in security operations by minimizing the repetitive, manual tasks that often contribute to operator fatigue. Automation and orchestration significantly reduce a security team's workload by automating routine tasks, such as scanning for vulnerabilities, applying patches, or monitoring systems for anomalous activities. This allows for the more efficient use of resources and frees security personnel to focus on more complex, strategic issues that require human judgment and creativity rather than repetitive tasks. Orchestration enhances the impact of automation by coordinating automated tasks across different systems and software tools and reduces detection and  reaction times.

For example, if a threat is detected, an orchestrated system can automatically isolate the affected subnet, perform basic analysis and reporting, notify security teams, generate tickets, and document the incident, all without human intervention. Other benefits of automation include enforcing standardized baselines through configuration management tools to override unauthorized changes made to endpoints automatically. A standard baseline in configuration management is a well-defined set of approved configurations and settings that serve as a reference point for establishing and maintaining the desired state of a system. Automation and orchestration can significantly alleviate operator fatigue by reducing the volume of manual, routine tasks and improving the efficiency of security operations, leading to greater job satisfaction, increased alertness and effectiveness in threat detection and response, and, ultimately, more robust security operations.

Automation can support staff retention initiatives by reducing fatigue from repetitive tasks. Automation practices can free staff to perform more rewarding work and increase job satisfaction.
Important Considerations

While automation and orchestration provide numerous benefits, they also present some significant challenges, some of which are listed below:

Complexity — Implementing automation and orchestration requires a deep understanding of an organization's systems, processes, and interdependencies. A poorly planned or executed automation strategy can add complexity, making systems more difficult to manage and maintain.
Cost — The initial cost of implementing automation and orchestration can be high, including costs associated with acquiring and developing appropriate tools, integrating them into existing systems, and training staff to use them effectively. Automation software maintenance and upgrades can also be costly.
Single Point of Failure — If a critical automated system or process fails, it could impact multiple areas of the organization, causing widespread problems.
Technical Debt — Organizations can accrue technical debt if automation and orchestration tools are implemented hastily, resulting in poorly documented code, "brittle" system integrations, or poor maintenance. Over time, this debt can lead to system instability, complexity, and increased costs, ironically similar to the problems associated mainly with legacy systems.
Ongoing Support — Automation and orchestration systems require ongoing support to stay effective and secure, including updates and patches, reviewing and improving automated processes, and continuous education. Without adequate support, the benefits of automation and orchestration are quickly eroded.
Maintaining system security when new hardware or infrastructure items are added to the network can be achieved by enforcing  standard configurations across the company. With automated configurations, these newly added items can be kept up-to-date and secure.
