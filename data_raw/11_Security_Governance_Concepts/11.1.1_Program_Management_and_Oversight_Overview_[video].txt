1. Program Management and Oversight Overview
00:04
A critical component of any Information Security
00:06
plan is proper program management and oversight.
00:09
This ensures that all security controls put in
00:11
place are being implemented and working properly.
00:14
In this lesson, we'll look at some of the key
00:16
elements of effective security governance, including
00:19
organizational standards, external considerations, and
00:22
ongoing monitoring and revision of the security plan.<br>
2. Standards
00:25
A proper security plan will include policies,
00:28
procedures, guidelines, and standards.
00:31
Policies are essentially organizational
00:32
rules that must be followed by employees.
00:35
A common example is an Acceptable Use Policy.
00:38
Procedures outline how certain
00:40
functions should be performed.
00:42
Guidelines are designed to provide support and
00:44
additional information on policies and procedures.
00:47
Standards define how the policies are implemented.<br>
00:50
For example, an organization may have a policy that
00:53
access control must be implemented on certain data types.
00:56
The organization would then implement standards
00:59
that define who can access the data, how they
01:01
can access it, and how access is monitored.<br>
01:04
Password policies are typically defined in an organization.
01:08
The standards define the length and complexity of
01:10
the password, how often a password can be reused,
01:13
and how often the password should be changed.<br>
01:16
For example, the standards might state that the
01:18
password should be a minimum of 8 characters, including
01:21
upper and lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and that
01:24
there should not be a set time to change the password.
01:27
The standard can even define that
01:29
multi-factor authentication should be used.<br>
01:32
Some other common standards an organization
01:34
should have defined include physical security
01:36
measures such as cameras, physical access control,
01:39
and security guard schedules and placements.
01:41
To protect sensitive data, encryption standards should also
01:44
be defined and implemented throughout the organization.<br>
3. External Considerations
01:48
External considerations must be looked
01:50
at when establishing internal policies.
01:52
Perhaps the biggest external consideration
01:55
is any laws that apply to the organization.<br>
01:58
For example, in the health industry, the Health
02:00
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or
02:02
HIPAA, establishes laws and regulations that
02:05
must be followed by any health organization.
02:08
These laws and regulations define how data is
02:10
secured, who can access patient data, and more.
02:14
When internal policies are established, they must
02:16
adhere to the regulations established by the law.<br>
02:19
Aside from regulatory and legal compliance, we also need
02:23
to consider any industry standards that may be in place.
02:26
For example, in the IT field, the National
02:28
Institute of Standards and Technology, or
02:31
NIST, publishes various industry standards.
02:34
While these aren't laws or regulations, these industry
02:37
standards are put into place to define specific practices
02:40
that should promote performance and efficiency.
02:43
While some standards are globally accepted, others differ
02:46
between countries, states, and even between cities.<br>
4. Monitoring and Revision
02:50
Monitoring and updating of all policies and
02:52
standards should take place on a regular basis.
02:55
As new technologies come out, new laws
02:57
and industry standards will be released.
02:59
It's up to the organization to review these and update
03:02
their internal policies and standards as needed.<br>
5. Summary
03:06
That'll wrap up this lesson on
03:07
program management and oversight.
03:09
In this lesson, we first went over the differences
03:11
in standards, policies, procedures, and guidelines.
03:15
Standards define how policies should be implemented and
03:18
are a core component of any security governance plan.
03:21
We then looked at some external factors that should
03:23
be considered when developing a security plan.
03:25
These include legal and regulatory compliance,
03:28
industry standards, and even global, national,
03:30
and local standards and practices.
03:32
We wrapped up by going over why it's important
03:35
to monitor and revise the plans to stay current
03:37
with industry and regulatory changes.<br>
