1. Change Management Overview
00:04
Change is inevitable in the IT field.
00:07
Whether it's updating to new equipment or changing direction
00:11
mid project, you're bound to come across a lot of changes!<br>
00:14
In this video, we're going to talk about change management.
00:18
This is just the method we use to ensure that changes
00:20
are implemented as smoothly and effectively as possible.<br>
2. Change Request
00:24
Most organizations have an official
00:26
approval process for change management.
00:28
A business commonly uses change order
00:30
forms to document these requests.<br>
00:33
Change order forms are different for each company,
00:36
but they typically ask for the change's purpose,
00:38
scope, and extent, along with a risk analysis and
00:41
rollback plan in case things don't go as expected.<br>
3. Approval
00:44
So, after filling out your change order form, what's next?
00:48
Well, first, it must be approved by the change board.
00:51
A change board might consist of one person or
00:53
many people who approve changes to the project.
00:56
Board members might be managers, project
00:58
supervisors, and maybe even the CEO.
01:01
If you were developing this project for a
01:03
customer instead of for in-house use, the customer
01:05
would need to approve the changes as well.<br>
4. Purpose
01:08
The first thing the change board will want to
01:09
know is why you want to make this change at all.
01:12
You'll want to explain why the change is needed
01:14
and whether it'll improve a current process,
01:16
save money, or add additional functionality.
01:19
You might also be asked to explain how it fits
01:21
within the organization's current strategic focus.
01:24
The change board will also want to know the scopeâ€”what
01:27
exactly the proposed change will entail from start to finish.
01:31
A scope has many components, but it should always
01:34
include outcomes, cost, personnel, and systems.<br>
01:38
Some other questions you'll need to have a ready
01:39
answer for are: What are your desired outcomes?
01:43
What exactly do you want to change?
01:45
What are the desired deliverables?
01:47
How will you know when the project is complete?
01:50
The board will also obviously want to know how much this
01:53
is all going to cost, whether in money, time, or resources.<br>
01:57
You'll want to consider which personnel
01:59
you'll need to implement the change.
02:01
Will you need developers,
02:02
technicians, or administrative staff?
02:04
Be sure to include the contact information for a
02:08
point person who can serve as the change board's
02:10
primary contact for the project, if it's approved.
02:13
It's also important to explain which
02:16
existing systems will be impacted.
02:18
Most likely, you'll be working alongside live production
02:22
systems and any changes should be carefully planned out.
02:25
Will there be downtime or potential conflicts?
02:28
If so, you probably want to set up a sandbox to
02:31
test the proposed changes before you implement them.
02:34
As you can see, if there's literally
02:36
anything you think you might need for your
02:38
project, you want to include it in the scope.<br>
5. Risk Analysis
02:41
Before you propose a change, you also
02:44
want to analyze the potential risk.
02:47
Yes, even small projects come with some risk.
02:49
Be sure to ask yourself, "What could go wrong
02:52
if we implement these changes?" After you
02:55
think through that, the next obvious questions
02:57
are: How are we going to avoid these problems?
02:59
How difficult will it be to backtrack
03:02
if things turn out worse than expected?
03:04
Is the outcome worth the risk?
03:05
If it turns out that the risks outweigh the
03:08
rewards, you probably want to rethink your approach.<br>
03:11
Now, before you start anything, make sure
03:14
you get written approval for your changes.
03:16
Written acceptance protects you,
03:18
the change board, and the customer.
03:20
This ensures that all of you have a complete understanding
03:23
of the proposed changes and what they could entail.
03:26
You want to avoid misunderstandings that could
03:29
hurt your own or your organization's reputation
03:31
or that might end up causing expensive problems.<br>
6. Implementation
03:34
Documentation is critical to any
03:37
project from start to finish!
03:38
During the implementation stage, you want to be sure
03:42
to document all the changes you've made along the way.
03:44
Include the specific approvals you've received.
03:47
Once you're done, be sure to follow your
03:49
organization's end user acceptance process.
03:51
This ensures that someone who's going to be using
03:54
the system verifies that it's working as expected.
03:56
And be sure to document this as well.<br>
7. Summary
03:59
That's it for this lesson.
04:00
In this lesson, we discussed change management.
04:04
We reviewed the information that's
04:05
commonly needed for a change request.
04:08
Then we went over the importance of documentation during
04:10
a proposed change's approval and implementation phase.<br>
