1. Automation Overview
00:06
Think about the chores you do every day, like
00:08
washing your clothes or doing the dishes.
00:10
You could do these things by hand if you
00:12
wanted, but it would take longer and probably be
00:14
less effective than doing them with a machine.
00:16
The process of having machines assist human
00:19
labor is called automation, and a similar
00:21
mindset is used in many kinds of computing.
00:23
In this lesson, I'm going to cover a variety of facts about
00:26
automation so you can have a better idea of how this works.<br>
2. DevSecOps
00:30
The term Development, Security, and Operations
00:33
is more commonly referred to as DevSecOps.
00:36
This is the philosophy in which everyone in an
00:38
organization is responsible for their system's security.
00:41
This means that everyone should implement
00:43
security decisions in the same way that
00:46
development and operation decisions are made.
00:48
If everyone in a company becomes better at
00:51
security, the entire organization benefits,
00:53
and customers have greater software assurance.<br>
00:56
While this might take a while to set up initially,
00:59
it eventually streamlines the process for everyone
01:02
and leads to lower costs and development times.
01:05
During the software development process,
01:07
engineers constantly check each other's work and
01:09
test the software for bugs and vulnerabilities.
01:12
In this way, fewer vulnerabilities make their way into
01:15
the final product, which means that we end up investing
01:17
less time and money into fixing things post-release.<br>
3. Workflow Orchestration
01:21
In a musical orchestra, there are many different instruments
01:24
that are brought together to create something wonderful.
01:27
Members follow what's written on their music sheets and
01:29
the real-time directions given to them by the conductor.
01:32
Just like a musical orchestra, workflows can
01:35
be orchestrated to make them as efficient as
01:37
possible so that they produce the best results.<br>
01:41
A workflow refers to a collection of tasks
01:43
that are performed in a logical sequence.
01:45
Orchestration means that you plan these tasks in
01:48
such a way that they're as efficient as possible.<br>
01:51
For example, you can orchestrate different
01:52
parts of your workflow, including the
01:54
development, quality assurance, and security.
01:57
Orchestration often incorporates the use of tools that
02:00
automatically complete certain tasks in a sequence.<br>
4. SOAR
02:03
To help with workflow orchestration, many companies
02:06
are using automated cybersecurity solutions that are
02:09
able to quickly identify and resolve potential attacks.
02:12
One of these solutions is Security Orchestration,
02:15
Automation, and Response, which is known by the acronym SOAR.<br>
02:19
SOAR refers to a collection of software
02:22
programs that allow an organization's security
02:24
team to collect various inputs they can monitor.
02:27
The point of SOAR is to replace tasks that are
02:30
repetitive and done manually with automated workflows.
02:34
These systems automatically flag security incidents
02:37
and respond to them in a predetermined way.<br>
02:39
This means that these incidents are caught earlier.
02:42
This also frees up security analysts to spend their time
02:45
and attention on only the most advanced security threats.
02:48
For example, using a firewall application, SOAR
02:51
can automatically detect a brute-force login
02:54
attack and block the attacker's IP address.<br>
5. Continuous Integration
02:57
Another orchestration technique we see is
02:59
known as continuous integration, or CI.
03:02
When you work on a software development team, you often
03:04
have multiple people contributing to the same project.
03:07
The practice of continuous integration means
03:10
that you automate all integration changes made by
03:13
these contributors back into a shared mainline.<br>
03:16
In general, there's a central repository where all
03:19
code changes are merged into a single file that's
03:21
used to test the current build's effectiveness.
03:24
Under this strategy, developers try to merge their
03:27
changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
03:30
The new changes are then automatically tested to make sure
03:33
they don't break the application when they're integrated.
03:35
This can greatly streamline the development process
03:38
because developers don't need to manually discuss
03:41
the changes they make with the rest of the team.
03:44
This also cuts down on overhead costs and lets developers
03:47
focus on the code and not on a complex web of communication.<br>
6. Continuous Delivery and Deployment
03:51
Continuous delivery is like an
03:53
extension of continuous integration.
03:55
It automatically deploys all the changes
03:58
coders make into a production environment.
04:00
You have both an automated testing process and
04:02
an automated release process that you can set to
04:05
occur at whichever interval you feel is best.<br>
04:08
Continuous deployment goes a step
04:10
further than continuous delivery.
04:13
Continuous deployment means that any change
04:15
that goes through all the production pipeline
04:17
stages is automatically released to customers.
04:20
There's no human intervention in this process, and
04:22
only if the change fails one of the tests along the
04:25
way is it prevented from being pushed out.
04:27
This has the potential to create an extremely streamlined
04:30
process and quicker responses to customer feedback.<br>
7. Summary
04:34
That's it for this lesson.
04:35
In this lesson, we first discussed DevSecOps and
04:38
explained how this philosophy adds security
04:40
measures to every step of the development process.
04:43
Next, we discussed workflow orchestration and showed how it
04:46
can help the development process run more smoothly with all
04:49
the different elements aligned in the most efficient way.
04:52
A big part of this is automating whichever
04:54
elements can possibly be automated.<br>
04:57
We also introduced you to some tools to help
04:59
in your orchestration, including SOARS, which
05:01
lets the security team automatically collect
05:03
data to help them identify security threats.
05:06
And finally, we discussed how continuous integration
05:09
lets you automate the integration of changes from
05:11
multiple developers into a central staging area.
05:14
Lastly, we showed that you can use continuous
05:17
deployment to ensure changes are automatically deployed
05:20
to a production environment and pushed out to end users.<br>
