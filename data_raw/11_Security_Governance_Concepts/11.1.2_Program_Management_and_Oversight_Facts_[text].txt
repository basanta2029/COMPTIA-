11.1.2 Program Management and Oversight Facts

Security governance is a critical aspect of an organization's overall security posture, providing a framework that guides the management of cybersecurity risks. It involves developing, implementing, and maintaining policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines to safeguard information assets and technical infrastructure. Security governance encompasses the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, emphasizing the need for a culture of security awareness throughout the organization. Governance frameworks must manage and maintain compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations while supporting the organization's strategic objectives. Effective security governance also involves continuous monitoring and improvement to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the business and regulatory environment.

This lesson covers the following topics:

Governance and accountability
Governance boards
Government entities and groups
Legal Environment
Governance and Accountability

Governance practices ensure organizations abide by all applicable cybersecurity laws and regulations to protect them from legal liability. Governance and organizational-level oversight must manage many legal risks, such as regulatory compliance requirements, contractual obligations, public disclosure laws, breach liability, privacy laws, intellectual property protection, and licensing agreements, and interpret and translate these legal requirements into operational controls to avoid legal trouble, act ethically, and protect the organization.
Guidelines for Implementing Governance

Follow these guidelines to support effective governance controls:

Implement a governance structure that best supports the organization's objectives.
Leverage expertise through committees to support decision-making.
Establish a comprehensive list of policies, processes, standards, and guidelines.
Implement change management programs to maintain control and promote transparency.
Use automation and orchestration tools to improve consistency, reduce response times, and support compliance.
Governance Boards

Governance boards are crucial in ensuring an organization's effective security governance and oversight because they are responsible for setting strategic objectives, policies, and guidelines for security practices and risk management. Governance boards oversee the implementation of security controls, work closely with risk management teams to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and evaluate the security program's overall effectiveness. Governance boards drive organization-wide security practices through leadership, guidance, and accountability and ensure that security risks are effectively identified and mitigated. Governance boards unite executive management, security professionals, and stakeholders to ensure security is a top strategic priority aligned with the organization's objectives and values.
Centralized vs. Decentralized

Centralized and decentralized security governance models aim to achieve the organization's security goals, protect assets, mitigate risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. Additionally, they recognize the importance of security and the need for collaboration between stakeholders and departments. However, there are notable differences between the two approaches. In centralized security governance, decision-making authority primarily rests with a single core group or department that establishes policies, procedures, and guidelines and makes important security-focused decisions. Resource allocation, including budget and personnel, is controlled by this group to promote consistency and standardization across the entire organization.

In contrast, decentralized security governance distributes decision-making authority to different groups or departments to facilitate security-focused decisions based on localized needs and priorities. Each unit has greater control over the allocation of security resources to allow greater adaptability and tailoring of security capabilities.

The choice between centralized and decentralized security governance depends on the organization's size, structure, culture, and risk appetite. Ultimately, the goal is to create a security governance model that effectively supports the organization's needs while balancing security risks.

Hybrid governance structures combine elements of both centralized and decentralized approaches. It aims to balance the advantages of centralized oversight and decentralized implementation. Under a hybrid system, specific security processes and decisions are centralized, while others are delegated to business units or departments to facilitate the development of standardized policies at the enterprise level while providing flexibility and local control as warranted.
Committees and Boards

Governance boards depend upon  governance committees to assist in complex decision-making situations. The governance board is typically composed of executives with the ultimate decision-making authority and is responsible for setting the strategic direction and policies of the organization. This responsibility often requires executives to make critical decisions regarding subjects outside their scope of expertise.

Committees are specialized groups comprised of subject matter experts, stakeholders, and representatives from relevant departments that focus on specific issues, such as security, risk management, audit, or compliance. They provide in-depth analysis, recommendations, and operational support to the governance board to provide them with the critical information needed to make effective decisions.

Governance boards and governance committees serve distinct roles within an organization's governance structure. Governance boards are typically composed of high-level executives and external stakeholders; whereas, governance committees are typically comprised of subject matter experts and operational leaders.
Data Governance Roles

Security governance relies heavily on specially designed and interdependent roles: owner, controller, processor, and custodian. Each role carries unique responsibilities that contribute to maintaining effective security oversight and control.

Role
Description
Owner	A high-ranking employee, like a director or a vice president, typically holds the owner role and is ultimately responsible for ensuring data is appropriately protected. The owner identifies what level of classification and sensitivity the data has, decides who should have access to it, and what level of security should be applied. In relation to governance, the owner provides strategic guidance to ensure that security policies align with business objectives.
Controller	The controller role closely relates to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and identifies the purposes, conditions, and means of processing personal data. An individual, public authority, agency, or other body can fill the controller role. The controller ensures that data processing activities adhere to all legal requirements. In relation to governance, the controller helps maintain legal and regulatory compliance.
Processor	The processor is responsible for processing personal data on behalf of the controller and often represents cloud service providers (CSP) but could also be represented by vendors and business partners. Processors must maintain records of their processing activities, cooperate with supervisory authorities, and implement appropriate security measures to protect the data they handle. In relation to governance, the processor role ensures that data is handled securely and in accordance with the rules established by the owner and controller roles.
Custodian	The custodian, also known as the data steward, is responsible for the safe custody, transport, storage of the data, and implementation of business rules. The IT department typically represents the custodian role, and in relation to governance, the custodian role implements and enforces the security controls established by the data owner and controller and reports any issues indicative of a security incident.
Coordination among data owner, controller, processor, and custodian in managing and protecting data is crucial to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, establish clear responsibilities, and maintain data integrity and security.
Government Entities and Groups

At the government level, governance committees are often represented by specialized agencies. Several government agencies are associated with security governance and differ between countries and jurisdictions. A few examples of government agencies with security governance responsibilities include the following:

Agency
Description
Regulatory agencies	Regulatory agencies establish and enforce security standards, regulations, and guidelines. They oversee compliance with laws related to specific sectors such as finance, healthcare, telecommunications, and energy.
Intelligence agencies	Intelligence agencies gather and analyze information to identify and counteract potential security threats and provide this information to national-level government groups to steer national policy and military strategy.
Law enforcement agencies	Law enforcement agencies enforce laws and regulations related to public safety and security. They investigate and prosecute criminal activities, including cybercrimes and terrorist activities.
Defense and military organizations	Defense and military organizations are responsible for safeguarding national security and protecting the country from external threats. They develop strategies, policies, and capabilities to address physical security, border control, and defense-related cybersecurity.
Data protection authorities	Data protection authorities focus on protecting personal data and privacy rights. They enforce data protection regulations and provide guidance on the best practices for securing personal information.
National cybersecurity agencies	National cybersecurity agencies focus on protecting critical infrastructure, government networks, and national cybersecurity interests. They develop cybersecurity strategies, coordinate incident response, and provide guidance on cybersecurity practices for government entities and private organizations.
Legal Environment

Governance committees ensure their organizations abide by all applicable cybersecurity laws and regulations to protect them from legal liability. The governance committee must address these external considerations in the strategic plan for the organization.

Governance committees must manage many legal risks, such as regulatory compliance requirements, contractual obligations, public disclosure laws, breach liability, privacy laws, intellectual property protection, licensing agreements, and many others. Cybersecurity governance committees must interpret and translate these legal requirements into operational controls to avoid legal trouble, act ethically, and protect the organization.

The key frameworks, benchmarks, and configuration guides may be used to demonstrate compliance with a country's legal/regulatory requirements or with industry-specific regulations. Due diligence is a legal term meaning that responsible persons have not been negligent in discharging their duties. Negligence may create criminal and civil liabilities. Many countries have enacted legislation that criminalizes negligence in information management. In the United States, for example, the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates the implementation of risk assessments, internal controls, and audit procedures. The Computer Security Act (1987) requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information. In 2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was introduced to govern the security of data processed by federal government agencies.

Some regulations have specific cybersecurity control requirements; others simply mandate "best practice," as represented by a particular industry or international framework. It may be necessary to perform mapping between different industry frameworks, such as NIST and ISO 27K, if a regulator specifies the use of one but not another. Conversely, the use of frameworks may not be mandated as such, but auditors are likely to expect them to be in place as a demonstration of a strong and competent security program.
Global Law

As information systems become more interconnected globally, many countries have enacted laws with broader, international reach. Some examples include the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which both act to protect the privacy of the constituents associated with each respective law irrespective of geopolitical boundaries.
Personal Data and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Where some types of legislation address cybersecurity due diligence, others focus in whole or in part on information security as it affects privacy or personal data. Privacy is a distinct concept and requires that collection and processing of personal information be both secure and fair. Fairness and the right to privacy, as enacted by regulations such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), means that personal data cannot be collected, processed, or retained without the individual's informed consent. Informed consent means that the data must be collected and processed only for the stated purpose, and that purpose must be clearly described to the user in plain language, not legal jargon. GDPR (ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr) gives data subjects rights to withdraw consent, and to inspect, amend, or erase data held about them. Failure to comply with GDPR rules can result in incredibly large fines.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The CCPA provides California residents the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the purpose of collecting this data, and with whom they share it. It protects California residents' rights to access their personal information, delete it, or opt out of its sale. Organizations must inform consumers about the categories of personal information they collect and the purposes for which the information will be used. The CCPA applies to any organization, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to California residents; has gross annual revenues over $25 million; buys or sells the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices; or derives 50% or more of annual revenues from selling personal information.

Regulations and National, Local, Regional and Industry Laws

Many countries have national-level laws to support effective cybersecurity practices and protect citizen data. The scope and detail of these laws varies significantly from one country to another, but organizations must comply with the laws in all the jurisdictions where they operate.

Examples in the United States include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The United Kingdom's national laws include the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations 2018. Canada enforces a privacy law called Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), India regulates the IT industry with the Information Technology Act 2000, and Australia enforces the Privacy Act 1988. While it is not necessary to understand the details of each of these laws, it is important to understand that this complicated legal framework greatly influences the functional elements of a cybersecurity program.

While most cybersecurity laws typically have national or international scope due to the global nature of the internet, there are also laws and regulations with a more local or regional reach. These laws may be specific to states, provinces, or even cities, particularly in larger countries like the United States. Two important examples include the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) Part 500 Cybersecurity Regulation and the Massachusetts 201 CMR 17.00.

Industry-specific cybersecurity laws and regulations govern how data should be handled and protected. Here are a few key examples to help highlight that cybersecurity is a significant concern across all sectors of industry and is protected by a complicated matrix of laws that must be accommodated by cybersecurity operations and organizational governance:

Cybersecurity regulations are legal rules and guidelines formulated by governments and regulatory bodies to safeguard digital information and systems from cyber threats. They set standards for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, particularly sensitive and personal information. Regulations cover diverse capabilities, including data protection, network and information systems security, data breach notifications, digital identity verification, and many others. Businesses, government agencies, organizations, and executives must work diligently to comply with these regulations or risk significant fines and imprisonment.

Cybersecurity regulations aim to protect consumer privacy rights, ensure the security of the financial system, uphold the stability and trustworthiness of the Internet and digital economy, and protect critical national infrastructure from cybercrime. The applicability of regulations depends on factors such as the industry the organization operates within, the types of data it handles, and the regions where it conducts business. Here are a few key examples, several of which have been previously mentioned:

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
Monitoring and Revision

The cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving. Consequently, organizations must ensure that their cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and legal compliance practices associated with legal and regulatory compliance are regularly monitored, evaluated, and updated. These responsibilities are generally managed via collaboration among diverse groups to review existing policies, procedures, and standards and ensure their effectiveness against current requirements. Routine audits, inspections, and assessments are commonly used to measure compliance levels and identify new risks. The results of compliance reports, technological changes, business processes, laws, or newly identified risks drive policy, procedure, and standards revisions. Regular training sessions help to inform employees of policy changes and ensure continued compliance.

Additionally, organizations must maintain awareness of any changes in cybersecurity legislation in their jurisdictions, including international, national, regional, or industry-specific laws. Effective monitoring and revision of cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and legal compliance practices is a dynamic, cyclical process requiring diligence, foresight, and proactive strategies.
