1. Penetration Testing
00:04
Penetration testing, often referred to as
00:06
"pen testing," is a practice conducted to
00:08
assess the security of an IT infrastructure by
00:11
safely attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.
00:14
These vulnerabilities may exist in operating
00:16
systems, services and application flaws, improper
00:20
configurations, or risky end-user behavior.
00:23
The goal of this simulated attack on a system is
00:26
to identify any weak spots in an organization's
00:29
defense that attackers could potentially exploit.
00:32
It's designed to provide organizations with
00:34
valuable insights regarding their security
00:37
posture and ability to withstand cyber attacks.<br>
2. Before Testing
00:41
Before any testing can begin, the goals and guidelines
00:44
need to be established. These are spelled out in the rules
00:47
of Engagement and the Scope of Work documents.
00:50
The Scope of Work is a detailed document
00:52
that defines exactly what should be included
00:55
in the penetration test.
00:56
This document is also referred to as the
00:58
Statement of Work.
01:00
The Scope of Work should clearly
01:01
define what is being tested.
01:03
Specific IP address ranges, servers, applications,
01:06
and other network devices are explicitly listed.
01:10
A pen tester breaks the law if he or she accesses
01:13
anything not specified in the Scope of Work.
01:16
Once it has been decided what exactly can be tested, a timeframe
01:20
and payment agreements—if applicable— should
01:22
also be established and outlined in the Scope of Work.
01:25
While the Scope of Work defines what work
01:27
will be done, the Rules of Engagement define
01:29
exactly how that work will be carried out.
01:32
It should specifically state how sensitive data
01:34
should be handled and who should be notified if
01:37
something unexpected happens during the test.
01:40
It should also specify what test methods should be used.<br>
3. Active vs. Passive
01:44
In penetration testing, we distinguish between
01:46
two primary testing methods: active and passive.
01:50
Active Penetration Testing involves direct interaction
01:53
with the system to uncover vulnerabilities.
01:56
This could be attempting to exploit a known software
01:58
vulnerability or trying to crack a weak password.
02:02
In this method, the tester is directly
02:04
engaging with the target system, often
02:06
leaving a trace or log of their activities.
02:09
The main goal of active penetration testing is to breach the
02:13
system's defenses and evaluate the impact of such a breach.<br>
02:17
Passive Penetration Testing, on the other hand,
02:19
involves gathering information about the target
02:21
system without directly interacting with it.
02:24
This could involve network monitoring, analyzing
02:27
system logs, or even something as simple as googling
02:30
for information about the system or the organization.
02:33
The goal here is to gather as much
02:35
information as possible to understand the
02:37
system and identify potential vulnerabilities.<br>
02:40
Passive testing is more covert, making it less likely to
02:43
be noticed and, therefore, less likely to raise any alarms.<br>
02:48
Both methods are usually used and are important for
02:50
a comprehensive penetration test because both active
02:53
and passive testing methods offer unique perspectives
02:57
and insights into an organization's security posture.<br>
4. Penetration Testing Steps
03:01
A pen test might involve the following
03:02
steps: First, verify that a threat exists.
03:05
To do so, you'd use surveillance, social engineering,
03:08
network scanners, and vulnerability assessment tools to
03:12
identify weak spots where vulnerabilities could be exploited.<br>
03:16
Next is to bypass security controls.
03:18
This involves looking for easy ways to attack the system.
03:21
Sometimes, the simpler solutions are the most vulnerable.
03:24
For example, could the network firewall be bypassed by
03:27
gaining physical access to the computer in the building?
03:30
Once the computer has been accessed, malware
03:32
could be introduced using a USB drive.<br>
03:35
The next step is to actively probe controls
03:37
for configuration weaknesses and errors.
03:40
This could include weak passwords
03:41
or software vulnerabilities.
03:44
Finally, once vulnerabilities have been discovered, a pen
03:46
tester will prove that a vulnerability is a high risk by
03:49
exploiting it to gain access to data or to install backdoors.<br>
5. Summary
03:53
That's it for this lesson.
03:55
In this lesson, we talked about penetration testing.
03:58
We discussed outlining and documenting the goals of the
04:00
pen tests before testing begins, including specifications
04:04
regarding whether tests will be active or passive.
04:07
We then discussed the steps that
04:08
are taken during a penetration test.<br>
