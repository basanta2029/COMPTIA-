Alerting and Monitoring

Alerting and monitoring play a critical role in cybersecurity. Continuously monitoring systems and networks allow organizations to detect potential threats and breaches early. These monitoring systems trigger timely alerts, enabling security teams to take immediate action to isolate affected systems and implement recovery plans to protect crucial data.
Alerting and Monitoring Tools

The following chart describes several different commonly used alerting and monitoring tools:

Tool	
Description
Network monitors	
Distinct from network traffic monitoring, a network monitor collects data about network infrastructure appliances, such as switches, access points, routers, firewalls. This is used to monitor load status for CPU/memory, state tables, disk capacity, fan speeds/temperature, network link utilization/error statistics, and so on. Another important function is a heartbeat message to indicate availability.

This data might be collected using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). An SNMP trap informs the management system of a notable event, such as port failure, chassis overheating, power failure, or excessive CPU utilization. The threshold for triggering traps can be set for each value. This provides a mechanism for alerts and alarms for hardware issues.

As well as supporting availability, network monitoring might reveal unusual conditions that could point to some kind of attack.
Netflow	
A flow collector is a means of recording metadata and statistics about network traffic rather than recording each frame. Network traffic and flow data may come from a wide variety of sources (or probes), such as switches, routers, firewalls, and web proxies. Flow analysis tools can provide features such as the following:

Highlighting of trends and patterns in traffic generated by applications, hosts, and ports.
Alerting based on detection of anomalies, flow analysis patterns, or custom triggers.
Visualization tools that show a map of network connections and make interpretation of patterns of traffic and flow data easier.
Identification of traffic patterns revealing rogue user behavior, malware in transit, tunneling, or applications exceeding their allocated bandwidth.
Identification of attempts by malware to contact a handler or command & control (C&C) channel.
NetFlow is a Cisco-developed means of reporting network flow information to a structured database. NetFlow has been redeveloped as the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) IETF standard (tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7011). A particular traffic flow can be defined by packets sharing the same characteristics, referred to as keys. A selection of keys is called a flow label, while traffic matching a flow label is called a flow record. A flow label is defined by packets that share the same key characteristics, such as IP source and destination addresses and protocol type. These five bits of information are referred to as a 5-tuple. A 7-tuple adds the input interface and IP type of service data. Each exporter caches data for newly seen flows and sets a timer to determine flow expiration. When a flow expires or becomes inactive, the exporter transmits the data to a collector.
System monitors and logs	
A system monitor implements the same functionality as a network monitor for a computer host. Like switches and routers, server hosts can report health status using SNMP traps.

Logs are one of the most valuable sources of security information. A system log can be used to diagnose availability issues. A security log can record both authorized and unauthorized uses of a resource or privilege. Logs function both as an audit trail of actions and (if monitored regularly) provide a warning of intrusion attempts. Log review is a critical part of security assurance. Only referring to the logs following a major incident is missing the opportunity to identify threats and vulnerabilities early and to respond proactively.

Logs typically associate an action with a particular user. This is one of the reasons why it is critical that users do not share login details. If a user account is compromised, there is no means of tying events in the log to the actual attacker.
Application and cloud monitors	SNMP offers limited functionality. There are numerous proprietary monitoring solutions for infrastructure, application, database, and cloud environments. Some are designed for on-premises and some for cloud, while some support hybrid monitoring of both types of environments. An application monitor will include a basic heartbeat test to verify that it is responding. Other factors to monitor include number of sessions and requests, bandwidth consumption, CPU and memory utilization, and error or security alert conditions. Cloud monitors will assess different facets of cloud services, such as network bandwidth, virtual machine status, and application health.
Vulnerability scanners	A vulnerability scanner will report the total number of unmitigated vulnerabilities for each host. Consolidating these results can show the status of hosts across the whole network and highlight issues with a particular patch or configuration issue.
Antivirus	
Most hosts should be running some type of antivirus scan (A-V) software. While the A-V moniker remains popular, these suites are better conceived of as endpoint protection platforms (EPPs) or next-gen A-V. These detect malware by signature regardless of type, though detection rates can vary quite widely from product to product. Many suites also integrate with user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) and use AI-backed analysis to detect threat actor behavior that has bypassed malware signature matching.

Antivirus will usually be configured to block a detected threat automatically. The software can be configured to generate a dashboard alert or log via integration with a SIEM.
Data loss prevention	Data loss prevention (DLP) mediates the copying of tagged data to restrict it to authorized media and services. As with antivirus scanning, monitoring statistics for DLP policy violations can show whether there are issues, especially where the results show trends over time.
