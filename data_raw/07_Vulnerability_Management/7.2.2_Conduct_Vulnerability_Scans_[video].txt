1. Conduct Vulnerability Scans
00:04
Throughout this course, we talk about many scanning methods.
00:06
Typically, you scan for a specific
00:08
purpose, often to look for vulnerabilities.
00:11
Vulnerability scanning attempts to find points
00:13
that can be exploited on a computer or network.
00:16
A vulnerability scan can detect and
00:18
sometimes classify system weaknesses in
00:20
computers, networks, and other equipment.
00:23
The scan can also predict the effectiveness
00:25
of countermeasures that you might implement.
00:27
A scan may be performed by an IT department or
00:30
someone hired to perform a penetration test.
00:33
There are several good tools that
00:34
perform vulnerability scanning.
00:36
But if you're on a budget, you can use nmap with a script,
00:39
the Nmap Scripting Engine, to do a vulnerability scan.
2. Get the Nmap Script
00:43
I'm on a Kali Linux system.
00:44
This system comes with a whole bunch of
00:46
scripts, but the one we want isn't included.
00:49
That's not a problem; we can go out to the web and find it.
00:52
To get the script, we'll go to Github.
00:54
I've already located the web page with the script.
00:56
This is the one that we want.
00:58
I'll open that link.
01:00
Down here, in the description, it says that
01:02
the script uses some well-known service to
01:04
provide information about vulnerabilities.
01:07
That's really not a great description, but
01:09
I happen to know that it works pretty well.
01:11
To get the script, you need to click on this
01:13
Clone or Download link and copy the address.
01:16
Now, we'll open the terminal, type in 'git clone', paste in
01:20
the rest of the address, and press Enter on the keyboard.
01:23
I've already done that, so I won't do it again.
01:25
When I was doing this, I wasn't paying attention,
01:28
and it went into the root directory, so I had to go
01:30
in and move it to the /usr/share/nmap/scripts
01:34
directory so nmap knows where to find it by default.
01:38
If you have some basic Linux skills, it
01:40
shouldn't be a problem to move to the
01:42
directory before downloading the script.
3. Run the Script
01:44
All right.
01:45
On my network, I have a Windows 10 system,
01:47
and I've installed XAMPP on it with some
01:49
web pages, php, forms, and so on.
01:52
I want to put it out there facing the public internet.
01:55
But I'm not sure if it has any vulnerabilities.
01:57
This is my example.
01:59
I could also have other systems that I can scan.
02:01
But for this demo, I'm just going
02:02
to scan this particular system.
02:04
Since I'm familiar with this system,
02:06
I already know the IP address.
02:08
To begin, I want to just do a regular
02:10
service scan with nmap to see what we get.
02:13
For that, I'll type in 'nmap -sV
02:14
10.10.10.195' and press Enter.
02:20
It takes a few seconds to get the results.
02:22
When it's done, you can see that I have
02:24
a few open ports and services running.
02:27
As I already mentioned, this system is running a web server,
02:29
Apache, along with other services, so I'm concerned about it.
02:34
Now let's run this scan with the script.
02:36
To run the script, we'll type 'nmap - -script
02:38
nmap-vulners -sV 10.10.10.195' and press Enter.
02:47
This will take a few seconds.
02:49
The scan is done.
02:50
Now we have some additional information.
02:52
Right here, we have some information
02:54
under Apache and port 443.
02:56
I'm going to hold down the Ctrl
02:57
key and click on this hyperlink.
03:00
It'll open Firefox, and I'll go to the page where I
03:02
can read more about this particular vulnerability.
03:05
I'll scroll down.
03:06
Under the description, it tells
03:08
me exactly what this issue is.
03:09
It looks like someone could execute some code, so
03:12
it's probably not something I want to let loose on the
03:14
web until I do more research and fix any problems.
4. Other Scripts
03:18
While we're in Firefox, let's
03:20
jump back over to the Github tab.
03:21
I'll go back a page.
03:23
There are other scripts here that do some additional scans.
03:26
If you have a test environment (and you should), you can
03:29
download others and see what type of results you can get.
03:33
Remember that you can run multiple scripts in one scan.
5. Summary
03:36
That's it for this demo.
03:37
In this demo, we used nmap and the Nmap Scripting Engine to
03:40
do a vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 system running XAMPP.
03:44
First, we went to Github to locate the scripts we needed.
03:47
Then we did a regular service scan with nmap.
03:50
We did another scan using the script, and
03:52
then we used the web to learn more about one
03:55
of the vulnerabilities that the script found.
