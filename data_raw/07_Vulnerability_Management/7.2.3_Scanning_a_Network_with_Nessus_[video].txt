1. Scan a Network with Nessus
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to work
00:06
with the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner.
00:08
Nessus is a very powerful security tool that you can use
00:10
to scan for security vulnerabilities on your network.
00:14
Nessus is accessed via a web page on port 8834.
00:17
I've installed Nessus on this machine,
00:18
so I'm just connecting to localhost.
00:20
For this demo, I'm running an evaluation copy of
00:23
Nessus, but that's sufficient to show what it can do.
2. Create a Scan
00:26
Let's start by logging in.
00:28
After I log in, we see the home page.
00:30
Here, we can see the various scans
00:32
that have already been created.
00:33
There are many different features and options
00:35
in Nessus, but for this demo, I'll stick to
00:37
showing how to create and run a network scan.
00:40
While I could create a custom scan profile,
00:42
Nessus includes quite a few useful templates that
00:45
can accomplish most of what I typically need.
00:47
To create a scan, I'll start by
00:49
selecting New Scan from the top right.
00:51
Here, we can see some of the templates I mentioned.
00:53
I'm going to run a basic network
00:55
scan, so I'll select that template.
00:57
This template scans a specified host or
01:00
network range for known vulnerabilities.
01:02
To set up the scan, I'll need to provide a name for
01:05
it, as well as a network address that I'd like to scan.
01:07
I'm going to name this 'home gateway scan' since
01:10
I'll be scanning the computers at my house with it.
01:12
My gateway is located at 10.0.0.1, so
01:16
that's what I'll supply as the target.
01:18
There are many other options that I could configure,
01:20
including port discovery and authenticated scanning,
01:23
but I just want to do a simple scan today.
01:25
Since everything I need is configured, I'll click Save.
3. Scan
01:28
Now that I've returned to the home page, I can see that
01:30
the new scan has been created, but isn't running yet.
01:33
I can click Launch to start it.
01:35
The scan's title changes to bold, and a spinning
01:38
green icon appears to show that the scan is active.
01:41
I can watch the scan live by clicking on it.
01:43
This screen shows information about the different hosts
01:46
that are discovered and the vulnerabilities that are found.
01:49
Nessus also keeps a historical log of all the times a
01:52
scan has been run so that I can compare how
01:55
vulnerabilities have improved on my network over time.
01:58
This scan is going to take a while, so
02:00
I'll pause the demo until it's finished.
4. Scan Results
02:02
Now that the scan has finished, we can see that
02:04
my gateway has quite a few vulnerabilities.
02:07
Luckily, most of them are labelled as informational.
02:10
This means that the tool found information that could be
02:12
useful for a security administrator to know about a host, but
02:16
that the information doesn't immediately indicate a problem.
02:19
An example of the type of data that would be labelled
02:22
as informational is a list of open network ports.
02:24
Network ports have to be open on some
02:26
machines for them to function properly, but
02:29
opening unexpected ports can cause problems.
02:32
More serious vulnerabilities are
02:34
color-coded from green to red.
02:35
Low-severity vulnerabilities aren't as interesting
02:38
as high or critical vulnerabilities, so I'll take a
02:40
look at one of the worst issues Nessus found.
02:43
When I select a vulnerability, it
02:45
shows me information about the issue.
02:47
In many cases, software creators patch high and critical
02:50
vulnerabilities, and a relevant CVE entry is listed.
02:54
Nessus provide a description and a suggested
02:56
solution for many issues, as well as relevant
02:58
information related to the vulnerability.
5. Summary
03:01
And that's it for this demo.
03:02
We discussed how to conduct a
03:04
vulnerability scan with Nessus.
03:06
We looked at what Nessus is and what it does.
03:08
And we ran a vulnerability scan on my
03:10
home network and explored the results.
