1. SIEM and SOAR
00:04
To protect our networks, we usually implement
00:06
multiple automated devices such as IDSs, IPSs,
00:09
firewalls, and security configurations.
00:15
The problem with implementing these systems is
00:17
that the amount of generated data becomes
00:19
overwhelming for a human being to sort through.
00:22
To help with this, we implement SIEM and SOAR systems.
00:26
In this lesson, I'll go over each of these systems
00:29
and how they work to help protect networks.
2. SIEM Tools
00:33
Security information and event management tools, or SIEM
00:35
tools, work by gathering all sorts of information from a
00:39
network and putting it together in one central location.
00:43
More than just aggregating data, SIEM systems
00:46
can also actively read all this information
00:49
and determine if there's an actual threat!
00:51
Let's see how this works.
00:54
Everything starts with the collectors.
00:56
Log collectors are responsible for gathering event logs
00:59
from security appliances, host systems, and applications.
01:02
We can also add sensors to the system in order
01:05
to capture network packets or data inputs from
01:09
all the disparate systems on our network.
01:12
This data is sent to the event collectors, and
01:15
the event collectors send it all to the SIEM.
01:18
SIEM software takes this data, reads and analyzes
01:21
it, and separates it into different categories
01:24
such as logon attempts, database entries, port
01:27
scans, network congestion, and more.
01:30
You can review the reports to help
01:32
find any suspicious network activity.
01:35
If data exceeds the defined thresholds of normal
01:38
network activity, the SIEM sends an alert to the
01:40
security administrator, who then can investigate
01:43
it and take care of the threat as needed.
3. Next-Generation SIEM
01:46
The next generation of SIEM systems
01:48
are taking things to the next level.
01:49
By implementing artificial intelligence and machine
01:52
learning, these new systems can analyze user behavior
01:56
and sentiment to determine if a threat exists.
01:59
This can be used to detect threats like
02:01
spear phishing attacks and insider threats.
02:04
SIEM systems are great at helping network administrators
02:07
filter data and improve security monitoring.
02:10
But, any alert still requires manual intervention.
4. SOAR Systems
02:13
The acronym SOAR stands for Security
02:16
Orchestration, Automation, and Response.
02:19
SOAR systems also gather and analyze data,
02:22
but these systems take it to the next level.
02:25
SOAR is a solution stack of compatible software
02:27
programs that allow an organization to collect
02:30
security-threat data from multiple sources and respond
02:34
to low-level security events without human assistance.
02:37
Let's break this down and see how these systems work.
02:40
SOAR systems gather the same information as SIEM systems do,
02:44
but they also gather data from multiple third-party tools.
02:48
The SOAR system coordinates these tools,
02:50
sensors, and collectors to work together to
02:53
gather as much relevant data as possible.
02:56
This is the orchestration piece of a SOAR system.
03:00
You can set up a SOAR system to automate tasks
03:03
that are routine, tedious, and time consuming,
03:06
such as looking for and deleting phishing emails.
03:09
This is usually configured using checklists called
03:13
playbooks or a series of conditional steps called runbooks.
03:16
Automating these tasks frees up time for your
03:19
security team to focus on more important things.
03:22
Finally, a SOAR system is able to
03:25
automatically respond to threats.
03:27
For example, if malware is discovered, a SOAR
03:30
system can identify the threat and quarantine
03:32
it instead of just sending an alert.
03:35
SOAR systems help to reduce a security operation
03:38
team's workload by automating workflows and
03:41
handling low-level tasks automatically.
03:44
You should use both SIEM and SOAR
03:46
systems for improved security.
03:48
Your SOAR system can likely respond to the low-level
03:51
threats that the SIEM system uncovers, and your security
03:54
team can take responsibility for the higher-level issues.
5. Summary
03:58
That'll wrap things up for now.
04:00
In this lesson, we went over SIEM and SOAR systems.
04:03
SIEM programs work by gathering all sorts
04:06
of data from sensors and collectors.
04:08
Then this data is analyzed, and alerts
04:11
are sent out for potential threats.
04:13
A SOAR system takes this one step further and
04:16
is able to respond to low-level threats itself.
04:19
You can configure SOAR systems to automate basic
04:21
tasks that take up your organization's valuable time.
04:25
Using both systems can greatly
04:27
improve your network security.
