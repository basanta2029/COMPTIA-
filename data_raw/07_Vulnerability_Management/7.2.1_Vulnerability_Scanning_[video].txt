1. Vulnerability Scanning
00:03
A vulnerability scan is a security assessment
00:05
technique used to identify and evaluate
00:08
potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a
00:10
computer system, network, or application.
00:13
It involves scanning the target system for known
00:16
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or security
00:18
loopholes that could be exploited by attackers.
00:20
Vulnerability scans are performed internally
00:22
and externally to inventory vulnerabilities
00:25
from different network viewpoints.
00:27
Vulnerabilities identified during scanning
00:29
are then classified and prioritized for
00:31
remediation by security operations teams.<br>
2. Network Vulnerability Scanning
00:35
A network vulnerability scanner, such as Tenable Nessus or
00:37
OpenVAS, is designed to test network hosts, including
00:41
client PCs, mobile devices, servers, routers, and switches.
00:45
It performs three primary functions:
00:48
discovery, assessment, and prioritization.
00:51
During discovery, it examines an organization's
00:54
on-premises systems, applications, and devices.
00:57
It then assesses the scan results, comparing them to
01:00
configuration templates and lists of known vulnerabilities.<br>
01:03
Typical results from a vulnerability assessment will
01:06
identify missing patches, deviations from baseline
01:09
configuration templates, and other related vulnerabilities.
01:12
The tool compiles a report about each vulnerability.
01:16
Each identified vulnerability is categorized and
01:18
prioritized using an assigned impact warning.
01:21
Most tools also suggest remediation techniques.
01:25
This information is highly sensitive, so using these
01:27
tools and distributing the reports produced should be
01:30
restricted to authorized hosts and user accounts.<br>
3. Credentialed and Non-Credentialed Scanning
01:34
Credentialed and non-credentialed scans are two
01:37
different approaches to conducting vulnerability scans.<br>
01:40
A credentialed scan, also known as an authenticated
01:42
scan, requires the scanning tool to provide valid
01:45
credentials to access the target system.
01:48
This allows the scan to gather more comprehensive
01:50
information about the system's configuration,
01:53
installed software, and other details that may not
01:56
be accessible without proper authentication.<br>
01:58
In contrast, non-credentialed scans, also
02:01
known as unauthenticated scans, don't require
02:04
credentials to access the target system.
02:06
Instead, it relies on external scanning techniques to
02:09
probe for vulnerabilities and potential security issues.<br>
02:13
Both types of scans have their
02:14
own advantages and limitations.
02:16
Credentialed scans offer a more accurate
02:18
assessment of vulnerabilities but require
02:21
privileged access to the target system.
02:23
On the other hand, non-credentialed scans can be
02:26
performed remotely and quickly, making them suitable
02:28
for high-level assessments or initial security checks.
02:31
However, they generally provide a less detailed view of the
02:34
system's security posture compared to the credentialed scans.<br>
4. Application Vulnerability Scanning
02:38
Similarly, application vulnerability
02:40
scanning describes a specialized method for
02:43
identifying software application weaknesses.
02:45
This includes static analysis and dynamic analysis.
02:49
Static analysis involves reviewing
02:51
application code without executing it.
02:54
It involves examining the code for potential
02:56
vulnerabilities, bugs, coding standards violations,
03:00
and other issues that could impact the security,
03:02
performance, or maintainability of the software.<br>
03:05
Dynamic analysis involves executing a program
03:08
and observing its behavior in real-time.
03:10
It also tests running applications that can
03:13
identify issues like unvalidated inputs, broken
03:16
access controls, and SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br>
5. Package Monitoring
03:20
Another critical capability in application vulnerability
03:23
assessment practices includes package monitoring.
03:26
Package monitoring is the practice of
03:28
tracking and monitoring software packages
03:30
or dependencies used in an application.
03:33
It involves keeping a close watch on the versions,
03:35
vulnerabilities, and updates of these packages to
03:38
ensure the security and integrity of the application.<br>
03:41
Modern applications often rely on
03:44
third-party libraries, frameworks, or modules
03:46
that provide pre-built functionalities.
03:48
These packages can introduce vulnerabilities if
03:50
they contain outdated or insecure components.
03:53
Package monitoring helps identify such
03:55
vulnerabilities and allows developers to take
03:57
appropriate actions to mitigate potential risks.<br>
6. Summary
04:01
That's it for this lesson.
04:02
In this lesson, we discussed vulnerability scanning.
04:05
We looked at the three stages of
04:06
network vulnerability scanning.
04:08
We also looked at credentialed and non-credentialed scans.
04:11
We talked about application vulnerability scanning and
04:14
package monitoringâ€”methods used to enhance the overall
04:17
security posture of an organization's software.<br>
