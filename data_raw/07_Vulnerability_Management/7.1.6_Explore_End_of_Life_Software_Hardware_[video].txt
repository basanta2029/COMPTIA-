1. Explore End-of-Life Software
00:04
End-of-life in regard to software means there's a
00:06
date set when it will no longer receive any updates.
00:09
This normally means there's a new version already out
00:12
or going to be released, where developers will focus
00:14
on the new version of the software versus the old.
00:17
We're going to explore some ways
00:18
to keep track of the end-of-life.<br>
2. Website Tracking
00:21
One good way to keep track of this is
00:22
by finding information on the internet.
00:24
When a piece of software will no longer be
00:26
supported, the date will be published so tech
00:28
administrators will know when an update is needed.
00:31
One website we can check out is endoflife.date.
00:34
As you can see, all sorts of different
00:36
software companies are listed.
00:38
Some of the most popular pages
00:39
are listed here in the middle.
00:41
Let's take a look at Windows Server.<br>
00:43
After scrolling down, we can see that Windows Server 2012
00:45
R2 will reach the end-of-life starting on October 10, 2023.
00:50
Although this version of Windows Server
00:52
hasn't received full support since 2018, it
00:55
has been getting regular security updates.
00:58
If a software isn't receiving security updates,
01:00
it could leave you vulnerable to hackers.
01:02
That's why, in most cases, software will be listed as
01:05
end-of-life when it no longer receives any updates.
01:09
Now, the last window is what they
01:10
call extended security updates.
01:13
Usually, this involves paying a substantial amount of money
01:16
to receive updates past the normal security support date.
01:18
Once the extended date is reached, there are typically
01:21
no more updates to that version of the software.<br>
01:24
Let's look at one more example.
01:27
Red Hat Enterprise Linux goes through a similar phase.
01:30
There comes a time when full support isn't available.
01:32
Full Support may entail bug fixes and
01:34
features, while Maintenance Support typically
01:36
includes security updates and some bug fixes.
01:41
RHEL 7 will reach the end-of-life
01:42
starting on June 30th, 2024.
01:45
There's also an Extended Life Cycle
01:47
Support up through June 30th, 2028.
01:49
If you work in the tech industry, you should always be aware
01:52
of the end-of-life dates set by the software you manage.<br>
3. Network Scanner
01:55
Another way to be informed about end-of-life
01:57
software on your network is to scan your computers.
02:00
Network scanners can scan computers and
02:02
find what software may be installed on them.
02:04
Here, you can see that the CentOS 6.9 server is a device
02:08
that was scanned on our network; however, it's at the
02:10
end-of-life since it's not supported by regular maintenance.
02:14
Instead of going to each computer and
02:15
looking at a list, this could be helpful.
02:17
The same concept applies to software.
02:20
Installed software could also be marked as
02:22
end-of-life if it's no longer supported.
02:24
This could mean there's a new version of
02:26
the software out, or the developer who
02:27
originally made it abandoned the project.
02:30
One example is PuTTY.
02:31
You can see it picked up version 0.79.
02:34
If this same version were on other systems,
02:36
you'd see multiple computers listed here.
02:38
The version that's installed can be used as a comparison
02:41
to the latest version released by the developer.
02:44
Knowing what kind of operating systems and
02:46
software are installed on your network is a
02:48
significant step in keeping your network secure.<br>
4. Summary
02:51
That's it for this demo.
02:52
In this demo, we showed you how to research
02:54
end-of-life dates and how you can use a network
02:56
scanner to discover information on your network.<br>
