1. Data Loss Prevention
00:04
Every business has sensitive data in its
00:07
system, and protecting it is a high priority.
00:09
A data leakage incident happens when sensitive data
00:12
like credit card numbers, intellectual property,
00:14
financial information, or proprietary company
00:17
information is disclosed to an unauthorized person.
00:21
In this lesson, we'll look at five approaches to data
00:23
security, including data loss prevention, or DLP;
00:26
masking; encryption; tokenization; and rights management.
2. Data States
00:31
Data can exist in one of three states, and it's important
00:34
to use the right security approach for each state.
00:38
The first state is while the data is in use
00:40
on an endpoint system, like a workstation.
00:43
The second state is while the data is in motion, such as
00:46
when it's transmitted over the network or to the cloud.
00:49
The third state is while the data rests on a storage
00:52
medium, like a hard disk drive, or in a database.
3. DLP
00:55
Let's look at data protection through a DLP system.
00:57
A DLP system works like a guard at the perimeter of your
01:01
network, allowing unsensitive data to leave, but restricting
01:05
sensitive data from being transmitted out of the company.
01:10
A DLP analyzes the network traffic in accordance
01:12
with the organization's security policies.
01:14
For example, an e-commerce retailer could use a network DLP
01:18
solution to monitor for files containing credit card numbers.
01:22
If one of those files were being transmitted
01:24
out of the company, the DLP software would
01:26
flag it as a potential security problem.
4. Masking
01:29
Next, let's look at the masking approach.
01:32
Masking works by replacing sensitive
01:34
data with realistic fictional data.
01:37
There are different types of masking.
01:38
We'll look at dynamic data masking, and
01:40
then we'll look at static data masking.
5. Dynamic Data Masking
01:42
Let's start with dynamic.
01:45
Dynamic masking replaces original information with a
01:48
mask that mimics the original in form and function,
01:51
making it useful for data that's in use or in processing.
01:55
For example, someone's name would be replaced with another
01:58
name, or credit card numbers would be replaced with a
02:00
random number that contains the same number of characters.
6. Dynamic Data Masking
02:04
This method can be used to control
02:06
which users can see the actual data.
02:08
A bank could have third-party analytics
02:10
performed on their accounts while masking
02:12
the account numbers and clients' names.
02:15
With dynamic data masking, the
02:17
original data can be retrieved.
7. Static Data Masking
02:19
Another type of masking is static data masking.
02:22
This type is helpful for data at rest in a
02:24
database and can be specified by field or column.
02:28
You may want to use this method if you're making copies
02:30
of a database for testing, development, or reporting.
02:34
The complex algorithms in static masking make the
02:37
original data irretrievable through
02:38
reverse-engineering, so making a masked copy may be
02:43
a better choice than masking the original database.
8. Encryption
02:46
All right.
02:47
Next, let's briefly review encryption.
02:50
Encryption happens when an algorithm changes
02:52
plain text data into unreadable ciphertext.
02:55
The encryption algorithm has a variable that's called a key.
02:58
The authorized user that receives the encrypted
03:01
data can decrypt it through the cipher key.
03:04
This helps to protect data in motion.
9. Tokenization
03:07
Now let's look at a tokenization approach.
03:08
Tokenization is similar to encryption and
03:11
masking--it replaces actual data with something else.
03:15
But tokenization uses a randomly generated alphanumeric
03:19
character set called a token to replace the original data.
03:23
The token server stores the original data and is
03:25
protected by security measures like authentication and
03:28
authorization protocols so that the original information
03:31
is disclosed only when the correct token is presented.
03:35
This method is frequently used for credit
03:37
card numbers, bank accounts, medical records,
03:40
and other personally identifiable information.
10. Tokenization
03:43
For example, when you have a credit card number stored
03:45
on your mobile phone through an app, the app connects
03:48
with the remote token server, which creates the token and
03:51
replaces the credit card number stored in your phone.
03:54
Then, when you go to use your phone's app to pay
03:57
for your purchase at the store, the store's point
03:59
of sale terminal will contact a merchant acquirer.
04:02
The merchant acquirer presents the
04:04
token value to the remote token server.
04:07
The server uses the token to map back to your actual
04:10
credit card number and authorize the purchase.
04:13
An authorization is sent to the merchant, and a
04:15
message from the server is sent to your phone.
11. Rights Management
04:18
Finally, we have rights management.
04:20
Rights management is data protection at the file level.
04:23
With rights management, you identify
04:25
sensitive files in the file system and embed
04:28
them with your organization's security policy.
04:31
The key benefit of this approach is that the security policy
04:34
travels with the specific file even if it's moved or copied.
04:38
You can continue to control access to the file,
04:41
such as restricting who it can be transferred to,
04:43
even when the file is no longer on your system.
04:46
Rights management falls into two categories:
04:49
Digital Rights Management, or DRM, and
04:51
Information Rights Management, or IRM.
12. Data Rights Management
04:53
DRM is file level management applied to
04:57
rich media like music, videos, and software.
05:01
This strategy uses security technologies such as
05:03
encryption, permissions, product keys, limited install
05:07
applications, and persistent online authentication to
05:10
prevent editing, sharing, and unauthorized copying.
05:14
The purpose is to protect copyrighted media and software.
05:17
For example, when a consumer purchases a software
05:20
program, the program is not accessible without a product
05:23
key provided by the manufacturer at the time of purchase.
05:27
An example of continuous online authentication is when a
05:30
consumer logs in to an online application or streams the
05:34
information through an account that requires authentication.
13. Information Rights Management
05:38
Now let's move on to IRM, or Information Rights Management.
05:41
It's also called Enterprise Rights Management sometimes.
05:45
It focuses on business-to-business transfers for files such
05:48
as documents, emails, spreadsheets, and financial data.
05:52
Information rights management utilizes encryption and
05:54
permissions to create rules for the files, which can allow or
05:58
deny copying and pasting, editing, forwarding, and printing.
06:02
An example is a contract document that
06:05
only the recipient can open and digitally
06:07
sign and is denied forwarding abilities.
14. Summary
06:10
That's it for this lesson.
06:12
In this video, we review five approaches to data protection.
06:15
First, we looked at data loss prevention.
06:17
Next, we discussed two types of masking, dynamic and static.
06:22
We talked about encryption, which uses a
06:24
cipher with a key to encode information that
06:26
can be decoded with a key by the receiver.
06:29
Next, we discussed tokenization, which uses an
06:32
alphanumeric value as a token to replace sensitive
06:35
information that's protected by the token server.
06:38
And finally, we went over rights management, which
06:41
protects data through permissions at the file level
06:43
that stay with the file even if it leaves your network.
