1. Alerting and Monitoring
00:03
Alerting and monitoring play a
00:05
critical role in cybersecurity.
00:07
Continuously monitoring systems and networks allow
00:10
organizations to detect potential threats and breaches early.
00:14
These monitoring systems trigger timely alerts, enabling
00:18
security teams to take immediate action to isolate affected
00:21
systems and implement recovery plans to protect crucial data.<br>
2. Alerting and Monitoring Tools
00:26
Alerting and monitoring tools are
00:28
used to generate alerts in real time.
00:30
These tools often come equipped with
00:32
dashboards for visualizing data.
00:34
They also have advanced analytics capabilities
00:37
for deeper insights into network security.
00:40
There's a wide range of alerting
00:41
and monitoring tools available.
00:43
Let's take a moment to look at just a few.<br>
00:46
First are network monitoring tools.
00:48
These tools scrutinize and manage
00:50
the functionality of a network.
00:52
They help identify network bottlenecks and often predict
00:55
potential issues before they become serious problems.<br>
00:59
Next is a flow collector.
01:01
Flow collectors are a means for recording
01:03
metadata and statistics about network
01:05
traffic rather than recording each frame.
01:08
NetFlow is a network protocol developed by
01:11
Cisco for collecting IP traffic information
01:14
and monitoring network traffic.<br>
01:16
System monitors provide information about
01:19
the resources and performance of a system.
01:22
They can monitor CPU usage, disk activity, and memory usage.
01:27
System logs record the detailed
01:28
operations of a system or network.
01:31
They're critical for understanding system
01:32
activities and identifying abnormalities.<br>
01:36
Application and Cloud Monitors supervise the
01:38
operation of applications and cloud-based services.
01:42
They help ensure optimal performance and
01:44
uptime while also tracking unusual activity.
01:48
Vulnerability Scanners scan a system or
01:50
network to identify any security weaknesses.
01:54
They're an integral part of maintaining a secure IT
01:57
environment, as they provide the first line of defense by
02:00
identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.<br>
02:04
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools detect
02:08
and prevent data breaches, exfiltration,
02:11
or unwanted destruction of sensitive data.
02:14
They also ensure that end users don't send sensitive
02:17
or critical information outside the corporate network.
02:21
Lastly, a SIEM, or Security Information and
02:24
Event Management, is a comprehensive solution
02:27
that provides real-time analysis of security
02:29
alerts generated by networks and applications.<br>
3. Benchmarks
02:33
One of the functions of a vulnerability scan is to assess
02:37
the configuration of security controls and application
02:40
settings and permissions compared to established benchmarks.
02:44
This is known as benchmarking.
02:46
The scanner might try to identify whether there's a lack of
02:48
controls that might be considered necessary or any system
02:52
misconfiguration that would make the controls less effective
02:55
or ineffective, such as antivirus software not being updated
02:59
or management passwords left configured to the default.
03:03
This testing requires specific information about best
03:06
practices in configuring the application or security control.<br>
03:11
These best practices are provided by listing the controls
03:14
and appropriate configuration settings in a template.<br>
03:18
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
03:21
allows compatible scanners to determine whether
03:23
a computer meets a configuration baseline.
03:26
SCAP uses several components to accomplish this function.<br>
03:30
Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language, or OVAL,
03:34
is an XML schema describing system security state and
03:38
querying vulnerability reports and information.
03:41
Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format,
03:45
or XCCDF, is an XML schema for developing and auditing
03:50
best practice configuration checklists and rules.
03:54
Previously, best practice guides might've been written
03:57
in prose for systems administrators to apply manually.
04:00
XCCDF provides a machine-readable format that can
04:04
be applied and validated using compatible software.<br>
4. Summary
04:09
That's it for this lesson.
04:10
In this lesson, we talked about alerting and monitoring.
04:14
We reviewed several tools that can help with this.
04:16
We also discussed the importance of establishing
04:19
benchmarks for effective monitoring and alerting.<br>
