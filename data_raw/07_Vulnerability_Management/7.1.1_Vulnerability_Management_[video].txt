1. Vulnerability Management
00:04
A vulnerability is a weakness that could
00:06
be triggered accidentally or exploited
00:08
intentionally to cause a security breach.
00:10
Efficient vulnerability management plays a vital
00:13
role in securing your organization's network.
00:16
In this video, we'll discuss steps that can be
00:18
taken to manage vulnerabilities effectively.<br>
2. Identification Methods
00:21
Let's start by looking at identification.
00:23
Various sources can be used to identify vulnerabilities.<br>
00:26
Vulnerability scans are automated tools that
00:28
scan your system for known vulnerabilities.
00:31
These scans comprehensively analyze your system's
00:33
current security status, flagging any areas that
00:36
require immediate attention or improvement.<br>
00:39
Threat feeds provide real-time updates
00:41
on cyber threats across the world.
00:44
These feeds can provide information such
00:46
as suspicious domains, known malware,
00:48
known malicious IP addresses, and more.
00:51
Security defenders can use this information to stay
00:53
on top of the latest threats that might impact them.<br>
00:57
Open-source intelligence gathers
00:58
data from publicly available sources.
01:00
At the same time, proprietary third-party feeds
01:03
offer unique intelligence from private companies.
01:06
Information-sharing organizations offer
01:09
sector-specific threat intelligence.
01:11
Dark web intelligence can also provide insights
01:13
into underground criminal activities, including
01:16
selling exploit codes and stolen data.<br>
01:19
Penetration testing, often called "pen testing," is a
01:22
simulated attack that can be used to test your defenses.
01:25
They can help to detect security loopholes
01:27
before malicious actors find them.
01:30
A responsible disclosure program encourages
01:32
external individuals to report vulnerabilities.
01:35
Bug bounty programs take responsible disclosure one
01:38
step further by offering recognition or compensation
01:41
to individuals who report vulnerabilities.
01:44
Lastly, system and process audits help to
01:47
identify deviations from established policies.
01:50
These audits can help to highlight non-compliance
01:52
issues and pinpoint inefficiencies and
01:54
opportunities for improvement in current processes.<br>
3. Threat Hunting
01:58
Next is threat hunting.
01:59
This involves proactively searching through
02:01
networks to detect and isolate advanced
02:04
threats evading security solutions.
02:06
It's about being proactive instead of reactive, staying
02:09
one step ahead instead of waiting for an attack to happen.<br>
02:12
Threat hunting involves using automated and
02:15
manual techniques to detect cyber threats.
02:17
It begins with a hypothesis about a potential
02:19
threat, which is then investigated using data
02:22
analysis, system logs, and security tools.
02:25
The goal is to detect hidden threats,
02:27
understand the extent of any breaches, and
02:30
identify ways to prevent further attacks.
02:32
This proactive approach requires an in-depth understanding
02:35
of an organization's network, including all internal and
02:38
external connections, system configurations, and data flows.
02:42
It also requires an understanding of
02:44
current threat trends and tactics.
02:47
Automated tools can scan and monitor network traffic,
02:50
but the human element is crucial in threat hunting.
02:52
Cybersecurity professionals use their
02:54
experience and intuition to interpret the data,
02:57
identify anomalies, and track potential threats.<br>
4. Threat Analysis
03:00
Once vulnerabilities have been identified, they
03:02
must be analyzed to assess their potential impact.
03:06
Vulnerability analysis helps prioritize remediation
03:08
efforts by identifying the most critical vulnerabilities
03:11
that pose the most significant risk to an organization.<br>
03:16
Prioritization is typically based on factors such
03:18
as a vulnerability's severity, the ease of
03:20
exploitation, and the potential impact of an attack.
03:24
Prioritizing vulnerabilities helps an
03:25
organization focus limited resources on
03:28
addressing the most significant threats first.<br>
03:31
A standard ranking system is the Common
03:33
Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS.
03:35
The CVSS determines the vulnerability risk based on
03:39
three metrics: base, temporal, and environmental.
03:44
Base metrics describe a
03:45
vulnerability's unique characteristics.
03:47
Temporal metrics describe its changeable attributes, and
03:51
environmental metrics tell what vulnerabilities are only
03:54
present in specific environments or implementations.<br>
03:57
Scan results often list the
03:59
vulnerabilities by their CVE code.
04:01
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
04:05
This is a free and publicly available list of standardized
04:08
identifiers for known software vulnerabilities and exposures.
04:11
There are currently 94 CVE numbering authorities from
04:15
16 countries, which provides a baseline for evaluation.
04:20
CVE also provides standardization, which allows data
04:22
exchange for cybersecurity automation and aids professionals
04:25
as they determine the best assessment tools for themselves.<br>
5. Threat Response and Remediation
04:29
Depending on the vulnerability analysis results, appropriate
04:32
steps should be taken to mitigate the identified risks.
04:35
Some standard remediation practices
04:37
include patching, cybersecurity insurance,
04:40
segmentation, and compensating controls.<br>
04:42
Patching involves updating software or
04:45
systems to fix security vulnerabilities.
04:47
The process includes installing 'patches' or updates issued
04:51
by software vendors to fix identified security loopholes.
04:54
Cybersecurity insurance is a form of
04:57
cover that offers a financial safety net
04:59
in case of cyber-attacks or data breaches.
05:01
It can cover costs associated with recovery,
05:04
including incident response, data recovery,
05:07
legal liability, and customer notification.<br>
05:10
Segmentation refers to dividing a
05:11
network into smaller parts or segments.
05:14
By doing this, organizations can isolate
05:16
parts of their network, limiting an attacker's
05:19
ability to move laterally within the system.
05:21
Compensating controls are alternative security measures
05:24
implemented when a standard control isn't feasible.
05:27
These controls help achieve the same security
05:30
objective and reduce the risk to an acceptable
05:32
level if the primary control cannot be implemented.<br>
6. Summary
05:36
That's it for this lesson.
05:37
In this lesson, we discussed vulnerability management.
05:39
We talked about various methods that can
05:41
be used for identifying vulnerabilities.
05:43
We discussed how threat hunting, threat analysis,
05:46
and threat response and remediation can play a
05:49
vital role in securing an organization's network.<br>
