This lesson covers the following topics:

Vulnerability scan
Threat feed
Other vulnerability identification methods
Vulnerability Scan

Vulnerability scanning is a fundamental task within a vulnerability management program. It utilizes automated scanning processes to identify and evaluate potential issues. Vulnerability scans focus on networks, operating systems, applications, and other functional areas to detect known vulnerabilities, including insecure configurations, outdated software versions, or missing security patches. Regular scanning is required to maintain an accurate picture of an organization's security posture and to identify new vulnerabilities.

Threat feeds play a vital role in enhancing the effectiveness of vulnerability management by providing real-time information about emerging threats and newly discovered vulnerabilities. Threat feeds aggregate data from various sources, including cybersecurity researchers, vendors, and global security communities. These are integrated into vulnerability scanning tools to improve their detection capabilities. By leveraging threat feeds, organizations can stay ahead of the threat landscape, enabling them to prioritize and address the most critical vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
Threat Feed

Another essential element of vulnerability management is the use of threat feeds. These are real-time, continuously updated sources of information about potential threats and vulnerabilities, often gathered from multiple sources. By integrating threat feeds into their vulnerability management practices, organizations can stay aware of the latest risks and respond more swiftly.

Threat feeds are pivotal in vulnerability scanning by providing real-time, continuous data about the latest vulnerabilities, exploits, and threat actors. These feeds serve as a valuable resource for enhancing the organization's threat intelligence and enabling quicker identification and remediation of potential vulnerabilities. They integrate data from various sources, including security vendors, cybersecurity organizations, and open-source intelligence, to comprehensively view the threat landscape.

Common threat feed platforms include AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange (OTX), IBM's X-Force Exchange, and Recorded Future. These platforms gather, analyze, and distribute information about new and emerging threats, providing actionable intelligence that can be incorporated into an organization's vulnerability management practices and sometimes directly into security infrastructure tools to provide up-to-the-minute protections.

Threat feeds significantly improve vulnerability identification by providing timely information and context about new threats that traditional vulnerability scanning does not provide. Threat feeds offer information that helps organizations focus their remediation efforts on the most relevant and potentially damaging vulnerabilities first. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the time between discovering a vulnerability and its remediation, thus minimizing the organization's exposure to potential attacks.

The following table describes several types of threat feeds:

Threat intelligence platforms and feeds are supplied as one of three different commercial models:
Threat Feed Type	Description
Third-party threat feeds	
Open-source and proprietary threat feeds provide valuable real-time information on the latest cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Both feed types aggregate data from various sources and can be integrated into an organization's security infrastructure, contributing to a proactive cybersecurity strategy.

The choice between open-source and proprietary threat feeds often comes down to essential attributes. Open-source feeds, such as those provided by the Cyber Threat Alliance or the MISP threat-sharing platform, are typically free and accessible to all, making them a cost-effective solution for smaller organizations or those with limited budgets. However, they may lack the depth, breadth, or sophistication of analysis found in proprietary feeds.

Proprietary threat feeds often provide more comprehensive information and advanced analytic insights. However, these feeds come at a cost, and the return on investment will depend on an organization's specific needs, risk profile, and resources. Some organizations may use a combination of both open-source and proprietary feeds to achieve a balance of cost and coverage.

The outputs from the primary research undertaken by threat data feed providers and academics can take three main forms:

Behavioral Threat Research — is narrative commentary describing examples of attacks and TTPs gathered through primary research sources.
Reputational threat intelligence — is lists of IP addresses and domains associated with malicious behavior, plus signatures of known file-based malware.
Threat Data — is computer data that can correlate events observed on a customer's networks and logs with known TTP and threat actor indicators.
Threat data can be packaged as feeds integrating with a security information and event management (SIEM) platform. These feeds are usually described as cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data. The data is not a complete security solution; the threat data must be correlated with observed data from customer networks to produce actionable intelligence. This type of analysis is often powered by the SIEM's artificial intelligence (AI) features.

Closed/proprietary — is where threat research and CTI data are available as a paid subscription to a commercial threat intelligence platform. The security solution provider will also make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers through blogs, white papers, and webinars. Some examples of such platforms include the following:
IBM X-Force Exchange (exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com)
Mandiant's FireEye (mandiant.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)
Recorded Future (recordedfuture.com/platform/threat-intelligence)
Open-source intelligence	
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) describes collecting and analyzing publicly available information and using it to support decision-making. In cybersecurity operations, OSINT is used to identify vulnerabilities and threat information by gathering data from many sources such as blogs, forums, social media platforms, and even the dark web. This can include information about new types of malware, attack strategies used by cybercriminals, and recently discovered software vulnerabilities. Security researchers can use OSINT tools to automatically collect and analyze this information, identifying potential threats or vulnerabilities that could impact their organization.

Some standard OSINT tools include Shodan for investigating internet-connected devices, Maltego for visualizing complex networks of information, Recon-ng for web-based reconnaissance activities, and theHarvester for gathering emails, subdomains, hosts, and employee names from different public sources.
Information-sharing organization	
Threat feed information-sharing organizations are collaborative groups that exchange data about emerging cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. These organizations collect, analyze, and disseminate threat intelligence from various sources, including their members, security researchers, and public sources. Members of these organizations, often composed of businesses, government entities, and academic institutions, can benefit from the shared intelligence by gaining insights into the latest threats they might not have access to individually. They can use this information to fortify their systems and respond swiftly to emerging threats.

Examples of such organizations include the Cyber Threat Alliance and the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), which span various industries. These organizations are crucial in enhancing collective cybersecurity resilience and promoting a collaborative approach to tackling cyber threats.
Deep and dark web	
Threat research is a counterintelligence gathering effort in which security companies and researchers attempt to discover modern cyber adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). There are many companies and academic institutions engaged in primary cybersecurity research. Security solution providers with firewall and antimalware platforms derive much data from their customers' networks. As they assist customers with cybersecurity operations, they can analyze and publicize TTPs and their indicators. These organizations also operate honeynets to observe how hackers interact with vulnerable systems.

The deep web and dark web are also sources of threat intelligence. The deep web is any part of the World Wide Web not indexed by a search engine. This includes pages that require registration, pages that block search indexing, unlinked pages, pages using nonstandard DNS, and content encoded nonstandardly. Within the deep web are areas that are deliberately concealed from "regular" browser access.

Dark net — is a network established as an overlay to internet infrastructure by software, such as The Onion Router (TOR), Freenet, or I2P, that acts to anonymize usage and prevent a third party from knowing about the existence of the network or analyzing any activity taking place over the network. Onion routing, for instance, uses multiple layers of encryption and relays between nodes to achieve this anonymity.
Dark web — websites, content, and services accessible only over a dark net. While there are dark web search engines, many sites are hidden from them. Access to a dark website via its URL is often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.
Investigating these dark websites and message boards is a valuable source of counterintelligence. The anonymity of dark web services has made it easy for investigators to infiltrate the forums and web stores set up to exchange stolen data and hacking tools. As adversaries react to this, they set up new networks and ways of identifying law enforcement infiltration. Consequently, dark nets and the dark web represent a continually shifting landscape.

Please note that participating in illegal dark web activities is strictly prohibited. To stay safe, it is essential to exercise caution and follow legal and ethical guidelines when exploring the dark web.

The dark web is generally associated with illicit activities and illegal content but has legitimate purposes.

Privacy and Anonymity — The dark web provides a platform for enhanced privacy and anonymity. It allows users to communicate and browse the internet without revealing their identity or location. It can be valuable for whistleblowers, journalists, activists, or individuals living under repressive government regimes.
Access to Censored Information — In countries with strict internet censorship, the dark web can be an avenue for accessing information that is otherwise blocked or restricted. It enables individuals to bypass censorship and access politically sensitive or controversial content.
Research and Information Sharing — Some academic researchers or cybersecurity professionals may explore the dark web to gain insights into criminal activities and analyze emerging threats to improve cybersecurity operations.
Other Vulnerability Identification Methods

The following table reviews three additional vulnerability identification methods:

Method	Description
Penetration testing	Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a more aggressive approach to vulnerability management. Ethical hackers attempt to breach an organization's security in this practice, exploiting vulnerabilities to demonstrate their potential impact. While automated vulnerability scans and threat feeds are essential components of a robust security program, they may sometimes fail to identify specific vulnerabilities that a penetration test can uncover.
Bug bounties	
Bug bounty programs are another proactive strategy and describe when organizations incentivize discovering and reporting vulnerabilities by rewarding external security researchers or "white hat" hackers. Both penetration testing and bug bounty programs are proactive cybersecurity practices to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in a system or application. They both involve exploiting vulnerabilities to understand their potential impact, with the difference lying primarily in who conducts the testing and how it's structured. Penetration testing is typically performed by a hired team of professional ethical hackers within a confined time frame, using a structured approach based on the organization's requirements. This approach allows for a focused, in-depth examination of specific systems or applications and provides a predictable cost and timeline.

In contrast, bug bounty programs open the testing process to a global community of independent security researchers. Rewards for finding and reporting vulnerabilities incentivize these researchers. This approach can bring diverse skills and perspectives to testing, potentially uncovering more complex or obscure vulnerabilities.

An organization may choose penetration testing for a more controlled, targeted assessment, especially when testing specific components or meeting certain compliance requirements. A bug bounty program might be preferred when seeking a more extensive range of testing, leveraging the collective skills of a global community. However, many organizations see the value in both and use a combination of pen testing and bug bounty programs to ensure comprehensive vulnerability management. Responsible disclosure programs are established by organizations to encourage individuals to report security vulnerabilities in software or systems, allowing the organization to address and fix these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously. Responsible disclosure programs provide guidelines and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and often reward or recognize individuals who responsibly disclose verified security issues.
Auditing	
Auditing is an essential part of vulnerability management. Where product audits focus on specific features, such as application code, system/ process audits interrogate the wider use and deployment of products, including supply chain, configuration, support, monitoring, and cybersecurity. Security audits assess an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures, often using standards like ISO 27001 or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as benchmarks. These audits can identify technical vulnerabilities and operational weaknesses impacting an organization's security posture.

Cybersecurity audits are comprehensive reviews designed to ensure an organization's security posture aligns with established standards and best practices. There are various types of cybersecurity audits, including compliance audits, which assess adherence to regulations like GDPR or HIPAA; risk-based audits, which identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in an organization's systems and processes; and technical audits, which delve into the specifics of the organization's IT infrastructure, examining areas like network security, access controls, and data protection measures.

Penetration testing fits into cybersecurity audit practices as a critical component of a technical audit as it provides a practical assessment of the organization's defenses by simulating real-world attack scenarios. Rather than simply evaluating policies or configurations, penetration tests seek exploitable vulnerabilities, providing a clear picture of what an attacker might achieve. The findings from these tests are then used to improve the organization's security controls and mitigate identified risks.

Penetration tests also play an important role in compliance audits, as many regulations require organizations to conduct regular penetration testing as part of their cybersecurity program. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates annual and proactive penetration tests for organizations handling cardholder data.
