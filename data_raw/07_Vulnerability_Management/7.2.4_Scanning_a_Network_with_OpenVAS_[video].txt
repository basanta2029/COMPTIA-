1. Scanning a Network with OpenVAS
00:04
Greenbone's OpenVAS is a powerful network
00:06
security scanner equipped with various tools,
00:09
including an intuitive graphical user interface.
00:11
At its core, OpenVAS comprises a server packed with a
00:14
suite of network vulnerability tests designed to identify
00:17
security issues within remote systems and applications.
00:21
This versatile tool serves offensive and
00:23
defensive security professionals, enabling them
00:25
to assess and uncover potential attack surfaces.
00:29
In this demonstration, we'll continue to use the
00:31
traditional name OpenVAS when referring to the scanner.<br>
2. Getting Started
00:34
Before diving into this demonstration, I downloaded
00:37
OpenVAS as a virtual appliance and imported it into
00:40
a hypervisor, setting it up as a virtual machine.
00:43
The system is configured, and I've run
00:44
some tests, so we're ready to proceed.
00:47
I'm at the login screen and will use the
00:48
credentials created during the setup phase.<br>
00:51
After logging in, I'm directed to the Dashboard screen.
00:53
This provides a quick overview of
00:55
previous scans and their status.
00:57
It's important to note that security scanners, like
00:59
antivirus software, rely on up-to-date definitions.
01:03
Let's examine this briefly.<br>
01:05
I'll navigate to the Administration
01:06
tab and click on Feed Status.
01:09
This column shows that all our feeds are up to date.
01:11
I'm particularly interested in the CVEs
01:14
(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).<br>
01:17
Now, let's return to the Dashboards.
01:19
Please remember that this is a test system, and
01:21
the abundance of red indicates severe issues.
01:24
In a typical network, such extensive red flags
01:27
would be highly unusual and cause serious concern.
01:30
Now, let's explore the Scans menu.<br>
3. Tasks
01:33
Clicking on Tasks reveals a list
01:35
of all the tasks I've created.
01:36
For instance, the "Scan All" task scans my entire subnet.
01:40
In the Reports section, you'll see that I've run
01:42
this task three times, each resulting in a report.
01:46
You can also check the last time
01:47
the task ran and its severity level.
01:49
If I wish to run the task, I can start
01:51
by clicking the appropriate arrow icon.
01:53
Additional actions include deleting,
01:55
editing, cloning, or exporting the task.<br>
01:59
Now, let's create a new task.
02:00
There are a couple of ways to do this.
02:02
We can use the Task Wizard to quickly create a
02:04
task with default settings, requiring only the
02:07
entry of the IP address or hostname, whether a
02:10
single target or an entire range of devices.
02:12
Another approach is to click on New Task.<br>
02:15
I'll name the task Scan All since it's
02:18
intended for scanning the entire network.
02:20
Under Scan Targets, we specify what we want to scan.
02:24
I've created a new target by clicking here.<br>
02:26
This opens the New Target configuration window.
02:29
I'll name it Scan All and enter the
02:31
network address and subnet I want to scan.
02:34
Here, you can also specify exclusions if there
02:36
are devices on your network you wish to skip.
02:39
Credentials can be provided for a more comprehensive scan.<br>
02:42
After clicking Save, we return to the New Task window.
02:45
You'll see that the Scan All target is already selected.
02:48
For this task, we'll leave the rest of the
02:50
settings at their default values and click Save.<br>
02:55
Now, looking at the list of tasks,
02:56
you can find the Scan All task.
02:59
Since it's new, there have yet to be any reports.
03:02
While I'm ready to run this task, I
03:03
want to explore other menu items first.<br>
4. Other Scan Menu Items
03:06
Under the Scans menu, you'll find options like
03:08
Reports, Results, Vulnerabilities, and more.
03:12
Reports display a list of accumulated reports
03:15
since installing OpenVAS, while Results reveal
03:18
vulnerabilities discovered during scans.
03:20
For example, you can identify an operating system that
03:23
has reached its end of life and the affected host system.
03:26
Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial, as outdated
03:29
systems are unlikely to receive automatic patches.<br>
5. View Results of a Scan
03:33
Returning to the Scans menu, we'll examine the Tasks.
03:36
On the first page of the list, I'll select a
03:37
specific report, focusing on a task that scanned
03:40
IP addresses ending with "100," including a
03:43
vulnerable host called Metasploitable.
03:45
I'll click on the report and head to the Results
03:48
tab to view the issues detected by OpenVAS.
03:51
These issues range from passwordless
03:52
logins to an end-of-life operating system
03:55
and a VNC brute force login vulnerability.
03:58
Expanding on a particular point provides
04:00
detailed information and suggests solutions.<br>
04:03
Under the Scan menu, there's an extensive list of
04:05
menu items, including Assets, Configuration, and more.
04:08
Assets allow you to view scanned hosts, while
04:11
Configuration lets you create targets and credentials.
04:14
Lastly, the Administration and Help sections provide
04:17
access to administration tasks and helpful resources.<br>
6. Summary
04:20
This concludes our demonstration.
04:22
We explored Greenbone's Open Vulnerability
04:24
Assessment Scanner, also known simply as OpenVAS.<br>
