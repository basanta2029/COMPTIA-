1. Isolate, Containment and Segmentation
00:04
Today, we'll be discussing isolation, containment,
00:06
and segmentation within network security.
00:09
Let's get started.
2. Isolation
00:10
Isolation is limiting the ability of a
00:12
compromised asset or application from doing
00:15
more harm to the network or its assets.
00:17
This can be accomplished in a few different ways.
00:20
One way is to practice process isolation.
00:23
This ensures that if a process is compromised, only
00:26
the resources used by that process are at risk.
00:28
This practice applies to operating systems as well as RAM.
00:32
In other words, it prevents any process
00:34
that is limited by access bounds from
00:36
accessing the resources of another process.
00:39
This is a trait of a stable operating system.
00:43
Isolation is considered a preventative security measure
00:45
since it's implemented before an event is detected.
3. Containment
00:49
Containment is the first step after an
00:51
event has been detected and identified.
00:53
This action can take a few forms.
00:55
An IT admin may disconnect a machine from the network by
00:58
simply unplugging the Ethernet cable or disabling the NIC.
01:02
If this network is connected to other
01:04
networks, this connection may be terminated.
01:06
The decision to disconnect must be weighed
01:08
against the amount of data being compromised
01:11
and the potential loss of forensic evidence.
01:13
No matter what, the goal of containment is to
01:15
limit the damage potential of malicious activity.
01:19
Containment requires action.
01:21
Once an IT security analyst detects and
01:23
identifies a malicious event, they must act.
01:26
In this scenario, the analyst is monitoring a physical
01:29
server that must be manually disconnected from network.
01:32
This means the on-site IT Admin must
01:35
jump into action as quickly as possible.
01:37
Time is of the essence since this event threatens the
01:40
physical server and also the servers in the branch office.
01:43
This is because the two networks are connected via a VPN.
01:47
Containment requires that the damage be
01:49
limitedâ€”even if it means taking a server down.
4. Segmentation
01:53
Segmentation is a strategic network design.
01:55
The concept is simple: keep sections of a network separated
01:58
so that malicious actors can't pivot within a network.
02:02
Segmentation can be accomplished through
02:04
VLANs, software-defined networks, switches,
02:04
subnetting, or even physical segmentation.
02:09
But simply being on a different subnet is not enough.
02:12
Rules must be implemented to control what kind of
02:15
communications can occur between assets on the network.
02:18
Many times, a network admin will create a DMZ.
02:22
This a virtual area where assets are kept
02:25
separate from internal network assets.
02:27
A network with a DMZ may have a single firewall or two
02:31
firewalls depending on how secure this segment needs to be.
02:33
No matter the topography, access between the DMZ
02:37
and the internal network is secure and controlled.
5. Summary
02:41
That's it for this lesson.
02:42
We discussed isolation and how
02:44
it's used to protect a network.
02:45
Next, we talked about containment, which is the
02:48
first action taken once an event has been detected.
02:51
We ended by discussing network segmentation
02:53
and how it can prevent unauthorized access.
