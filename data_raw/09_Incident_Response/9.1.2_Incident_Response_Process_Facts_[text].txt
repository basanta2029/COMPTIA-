Security Incident

A security incident is an event or series of events resulting from a security policy violation. The incident may or may not adversely affect an organization's ability to conduct business. It is crucial to organizations that security incidents are recognized and dealt with appropriately. The following table describes types of security incidents.

Type	Description
Employee errors	Unintentional actions by an employee that cause damage or leave network systems vulnerable to attack.
Unauthorized act by an employee	Intentional actions by an employee to cause harm to a company's network or data. This is also known as an insider threat.
External intrusion attempts	Intentional actions by a threat actor not employed by or associated with an organization to exploit attack vectors. The threat actor's intent is to harm an organization or profit from access to an organization's resources.
Virus and harmful code attacks	Tools used by threat actors to disrupt company business, compromise data, or hurt the company's reputation
Unethical gathering of competitive information	This is also known as corporate espionage. The goal is to obtain proprietary information to obtain a competitive advantage or steal clients.
Incident Response Process

A cybersecurity incident refers to either a successful or attempted violation of the security properties of an asset, compromising its confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Incident response (IR) policy sets the resources, processes, and guidelines for dealing with cybersecurity incidents. Management of each incident should follow a process lifecycle. CompTIA's incident response lifecycle is a seven-step process:

Preparation — makes the system resilient to attack in the first place. This includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and setting up confidential lines of communication. It also implies creating incident response resources and procedures.
Detection — discovers indicators of threat actor activity. Indicators that an incident may have occurred might be generated from an automated intrusion system. Alternatively, incidents might be manually detected through threat hunting operations or be reported by employees, customers, or law enforcement.
Analysis — determines whether an incident has occurred and performs triage to assess how severe it might be from the data reported as indicators.
Containment — limit the scope and magnitude of the incident. Incident response aims to secure data while limiting the immediate impact on customers and business partners. It is also necessary to notify stakeholders and identify other reporting requirements.
Eradication — removes the cause and restores the affected system to a secure state by applying secure configuration settings and installing patches once the incident is contained.
Recovery — reintegrates the system into the business process it supports with the cause of the incident eradicated. This recovery phase may involve restoring data from backup and security testing. Systems must be monitored closely to detect and prevent any reoccurrence of the attack. The response process may have to iterate through multiple phases of identification, containment, eradication, and recovery to affect a complete resolution.
Lessons learned — analyzes the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident. Outputs from this phase feed back into a new preparation phase in the cycle.
Incident response likely requires coordinated action and authorization from several departments or managers, which adds further complexity. The IR process is focused on cybersecurity incidents. There are also significant incidents that pose an existential threat to company-wide operations. These major incidents are handled by disaster recovery processes. However, a cybersecurity incident might lead to a major incident being declared.
