1. Create a Forensic Drive Image with FTK
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to discuss creating
00:07
a forensic disk image with the Forensic Toolkit.
00:10
It's better known as the FTK Imager.
00:12
In our scenario, we need to examine a hard
00:15
drive from a malicious employee's workstation.
00:18
Before you try this for real, make sure that your
00:20
organization considers you qualified to do this and
00:23
that you have the backing of your legal department.
2. Use a Write Blocker
00:26
The first thing we need to do is create
00:27
an image of the employee's hard drive.
00:30
Like I said, we're going to use the FTK Imager to do this.
00:33
Remember, when we're conducting a forensic investigation, we
00:36
don't want to modify the evidence in any way, shape, or form.
00:40
If this situation were to be litigated for some reason—"say,
00:44
the employee gets fired and then sues the company--then the
00:46
prosecutor could say that when we conducted our forensic
00:50
investigation, we planted the evidence on the hard drive.
00:53
That's why it's crucial to make sure that that hard drive
00:56
isn't changed in any way during the forensics investigation.
01:00
We're going to create an image of that hard drive,
01:02
and we're going to do all of our testing, examining,
01:05
and investigative work on the imaged copy of the
01:07
hard drive, not on the actual hard drive.
01:10
Once we've created that image, we'll use a second
01:13
tool to analyze the contents of the hard drive to
01:16
see if we can find anything that's questionable.
01:18
The first thing we need to do is
01:20
get an image of the hard drive.
01:22
To do this, we have to connect the hard
01:23
drive to this forensic workstation.
01:26
That's problematic because as soon as you connect a
01:29
hard drive to a Windows workstation, Windows immediately
01:32
starts writing little bits of data to the drive—"but we
01:35
don't want to modify the drive in any way.
01:38
So we can't just directly connect the drive
01:40
to a SATA connector on this workstation.
01:43
Instead, we need to implement a write blocker,
01:45
also known as a forensic disk controller.
01:48
Its job is to block writing to the hard drive.
01:51
It allows us to connect the employee's hard drive
01:54
to the write blocker, and then we connect the write
01:56
blocker to our machine, usually with a USB cable.
02:00
This prevents any write operations coming from
02:02
the operating system on the forensic computer from
02:05
going through to the device that we're analyzing.
02:08
So remember, when you're conducting a forensic
02:10
investigation on a hard drive and you're going create
02:13
an image, always use a write blocker to prevent any
02:17
type of write operation from occurring on that drive.
02:20
I've already set this system up with
02:22
a write blocker, and it's ready to go.
3. Create a Forensic Image
02:24
Let's go ahead and use the FTK Imager
02:27
to create an image that we can analyze.
02:28
By the way, FTK Imager is a free tool.
02:32
A lot of the forensic software is very, very
02:34
expensive, but you don't have to spend a lot of money
02:37
to be able to conduct a good forensic investigation.
02:40
There are a lot of free, open source, and
02:43
legitimate tools for forensic investigations.
02:46
Within Access Manager, let's click on Add Evidence Item.
02:50
Then we have to specify what we're going to add.
02:53
We're adding a physical drive because I've connected
02:56
it to a write blocker on this particular system.
02:59
Click Next.
03:00
We have to specify which drive
03:02
we want to create the image from.
03:04
You'll notice, when I click the dropdown list,
03:06
it picked all of the hard drives on this system.
03:09
You need to be very careful that
03:11
you don't choose the wrong one.
03:13
For example, if I were to choose Physical Drive
03:15
0, that's my local workstation hard disk drive.
03:18
We'd be creating an image of my local system, not
03:21
the actual drive that's being used for evidence.
03:24
Physical Drive 1 is the drive that
03:26
I've connected to the write blocker.
03:28
That's what we want to choose.
03:30
I'll click Finish.
03:32
We'll come over here, to the Physical
03:34
Drive 1, and we'll right-click on it.
03:36
We want to Export Disk Image.
03:39
Under Image Destination, we'll click Add.
03:42
Then we can specify which type of
03:45
destination image we want to create.
03:47
Raw (dd) is the default selection because it's
03:51
probably one of the most widely used imaging format for
03:54
forensics, so we'll just leave it set the way it is.
03:57
Click Next.
03:58
We need to document the evidence.
04:00
Remember, whenever you're conducting a forensic
04:03
investigation, you need to document everything.
04:06
In fact, you should take a picture of the entire setup
04:09
that you're using to analyze this hard disk drive.
04:12
You should take a picture of the drive, take
04:13
a picture of how it's connected to the write
04:15
blocker, and take another picture of how the
04:17
write blocker is connected to the computer.
04:20
You might even want to take a video of the entire process.
04:24
Under Evidence Item Information,
04:26
you'll want to assign a case number.
04:27
Let's do —˜1 2 3 4' and evidence number —˜5 6 7 8'.
04:32
Then we'll give it a unique description.
04:34
We'll enter —˜HD from Mary Worley.'
04:37
I'll put —˜Dana Fellows' down as the examiner.
04:40
Click Next.
04:40
We have to specify where we want to
04:43
store the image file on my computer.
04:45
I have a folder for my forensic images.
04:53
Let's create a new folder, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'.
04:54
I'll put in the same thing here for
05:02
Image Filename, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'.
05:05
If we want to, we can fragment the image--that
05:08
is, break the image file into multiple pieces.
05:11
This is a small hard drive.
05:12
I'm going to set that to zero, which basically means
05:15
we'll have one image file for the entire hard disk.
05:18
Click Finish.
05:20
We want to make sure that Verify the
05:21
images after they are created is checked.
05:24
It's also a good idea to create a directory
05:26
listing of all the files and the image after
05:29
they're created, so check that box too.
05:32
It can be useful for when you're searching for information.
05:34
Click Start.
05:36
At this point, the imaging process has started.
05:39
It'll take a little bit of time to complete, especially
05:42
if you're going to be working with a big hard disk drive.
05:44
I'm going to pause the recording
05:46
now and come back when it's done.
05:48
Okay.
05:49
As you can see, it's almost done verifying the image.
05:52
In just a few seconds, the process will be complete.
4. MD5 Hash and SHA1 Hash
05:53
Notice that it's created two different
05:55
hashes, an MD5 Hash and a SHA1 Hash.
05:59
For both of these, the hashes match.
06:01
The MD5 Hash matched, and the SHA1 Hash matched as well.
06:05
That's good.
06:05
That's exactly what we want to see.
06:06
I'll go ahead and hit Close.
5. Verify Image File
06:09
Before we end this demo, let's verify
06:12
that the image file has been created.
06:14
I'll open File Explorer and navigate
06:16
to the folder where we saved the image.
06:22
Here are the various pieces of information that
06:24
were pulled from the hard drive to create it.
06:27
We have the image file itself.
06:28
There's a CSV document that contains a listing
06:31
of all the filenames and directory names.
06:33
Last on the list, we have a document that provides
06:36
a nice summary of the image creation process.
06:41
It gives us the case number, our evidence number,
06:43
the description, the examiner, all the information
06:46
we filled out earlier, and the information about
06:49
the hard drive itself from Mary Worley's computer.
06:52
At this point, our image file is created.
06:55
The next step of the process is to use another
06:57
tool, such as Autopsy, to examine the image.
6. Summary
07:01
That's all for this demo.
07:02
We used FTK imager to capture a
07:05
forensic image of a hard drive.
07:06
We discussed the importance of using a write blocker to
07:09
keep data from getting tampered with and the importance of
07:12
examining a copy of the disk, not the original disk itself.
07:16
Then we made a copy the image and verified
07:19
that it was saved to the folder we created.
