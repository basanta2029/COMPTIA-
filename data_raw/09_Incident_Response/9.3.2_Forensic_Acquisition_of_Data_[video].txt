1. Forensic Acquisition of Data
00:04
A forensic investigator gathers evidence from many sources.
00:06
In this lesson, we will discuss software
00:09
and hardware sources of potential evidence.
00:11
We will also discuss the order in which
00:13
the evidence needs to be gathered.
2. Order of Volatility
00:15
The process of capturing volatile
00:17
data follows the order of volatility.
00:19
We need to preserve the most volatile data first and
00:22
work our way down to data that is more persistent.
00:25
If an attack is underway, your computer forensics response
00:28
team is probably going to capture volatile data before trying
00:31
to gather data from the hard disk or turning the system off.
00:35
The order of volatility is: RAM, Swap Files/PageFiles,
00:40
Hard Drive, Remote Logs, Archived Data.
00:44
These items must be investigated in this
00:46
order so that potential evidence is not lost.
00:49
Each one of these items has its own challenges and
00:51
potential dangers when acquiring forensic data.
00:54
Let's look at tools and approaches to
00:56
acquire and retain data from these items.
3. Disk
00:59
In a computer forensics investigation, the data
01:01
on the hard disk drive is a key piece of evidence.
01:05
A lot of the things that we do on a
01:06
computer system are saved in some way on the
01:08
hard disk drive, including virtual memory.
01:11
A wealth of data is there.
01:13
In addition, information attached to
01:15
deleted files may still be on the disk.
01:17
Therefore, the hard drive itself is a
01:19
goldmine of evidence for a prosecutor.
01:22
Caution must be exercised when
01:23
making a copy of the hard drive.
01:25
A regular file-for-file copy is not good enough.
01:29
It needs to be a sector-by-sector copy that
01:31
includes data formerly deleted but still accessible.
4. Random Access Memory
01:34
RAM is the most volatile of all computer data storage.
01:37
RAM is cleared when a computer is shutdown.
01:40
Once gone, it cannot be recovered.
01:42
Data in RAM can be copied as long as the system is running,
01:45
but should be done only by someone with proper training.
01:48
The data stored in RAM can have valuable information.
01:52
Many times malware like worms, viruses and trojan
01:54
horses are created as memory-resident only.
01:58
This makes catching them difficult.
5. Swap/Page File
02:00
Swap files, or page files, are a virtual extension of RAM.
02:03
An OS is designed so that if you are running low on
02:06
RAM it can place not-in-use information into the swap
02:09
or page file on the hard drive to be used later.
02:13
An admin can determine how much
02:15
space to allocate to page files.
02:17
For the forensic investigator, this is
02:19
another potential source of evidence.
02:21
The page file data does not automatically delete
02:24
at shutdown unless you change the default settings.
6. OS
02:27
The OS is a virtual treasure trove of evidence.
02:30
File systems like NTFS and Ext4 are
02:34
the roadmap to where data is stored.
02:35
There is also a registry which is a
02:37
database that stores information about all
02:40
the applications installed on a computer.
02:43
Registry keys are folder-like objects
02:45
that store application-specific
02:47
information for each application stored in the registry.
02:50
The recycle bin is where deleted files are placed.
02:53
Also the print spooler can be examined
02:55
to see the print history from a computer.
7. Device
02:57
In the last 30 years technology
03:00
devices have changed dramatically.
03:02
With the increase of digital devices there is an equal
03:04
increase in devices that may require forensic examination.
03:08
These devices contain all the evidence
03:10
a forensic investigator needs.
03:12
Each device, such as smart phone, tablet, laptop
03:15
and smart watch all share common elements, namely
03:18
RAM, CPU, logs and storage space.
03:21
A trained investigator must be familiar with all platforms.
8. Firmware
03:25
Firmware is the basic level of
03:27
software that controls some hardware.
03:29
Firmware is stored in read-only, persistent memory.
03:32
This non-volatile memory does not
03:34
self-delete and in many cases is not updated.
03:37
Firmware has become vulnerable to different
03:39
attacks like rootkits and even steganography.
03:42
The hard drive has firmware that can
03:43
be manipulated by malicious actors.
03:46
Extracting this data is difficult and requires
03:48
specialized training and expensive tools.
9. Snapshot
03:51
A snapshot can be a useful tool in capturing
03:53
the exact state of running systems.
03:56
Snapshots capture volatile data
03:58
in an ever-changing environment.
04:00
This tool is not a substitute for
04:02
the sector-by-sector copy of a disk.
04:04
The snapshots can be saved for future examination.
04:07
Snapshots are valuable only if taken of a running
04:10
system that is currently experiencing an attack.
10. Cache
04:13
A cache is stored data that is used to
04:15
improve the speed of the computing process.
04:18
There are different caches in a computer system.
04:21
Address resolution protocol, or
04:22
ARP, matches IP with MAC addresses.
04:25
This protocol has a built-in caching component that saves
04:28
CPU time and network bandwidth by referring to the cache.
04:32
Internet browser history is also cached and can
04:35
provide valuable evidence regarding search history.
11. Network
04:38
Network forensic data plays an
04:39
important role in an investigation.
04:42
Network appliances that are important in an investigation
04:45
are firewall, router, switches, domain controllers, DHCP
04:49
servers, application servers and web proxy servers.
04:52
There are also applications on the network including
04:55
intrusion detection and intrusion protection systems.
12. Artifacts
04:59
In computer forensics an artifact is
05:01
an object that contains forensic value.
05:04
Forensic value is evidence found on hardware or in areas
05:07
like registry hives that show indicators of compromise.
05:11
These indicators are a digital sign of a breach.
05:13
It is important to preserve these artifacts and
05:16
understand their value to a forensic investigation.
13. Summary
05:19
That's it for this lesson.
05:21
In this lesson, we learned the procedure used to prioritize
05:23
evidence gathering called the order of volatility.
05:27
We discussed different areas within a network
05:29
that contain potential evidence such as cache,
05:31
network appliance, OS, disks and RAM.
05:34
We also covered artifacts and how
05:36
they are defined and identified.
