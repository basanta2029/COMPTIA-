1. Backing Up a Domain Controller
00:04
In this demo we are going to do a backup of
00:07
our domain controller on a Windows Server.
00:09
To start, you need to install the Windows backup feature.
00:13
The first thing we need to do is go to
00:14
Manage, click Add Roles and Features.<br>
00:18
Now we're going to just select Default, Next,
00:21
Next, past everything until we get to features.
00:25
Then we're going to scroll down
00:27
and go to Windows Server Backup.
00:29
Select it, click next.
00:32
On the confirm window I can click Install.
00:35
Then that's going to go ahead and
00:36
install and that may take a few minutes.<br>
2. Windows Server Backup
00:41
Once that's installed, we can go to our tools all
00:43
the way down, scroll down to Windows Server Backup.
00:47
Using Windows Server Backup you can schedule regular
00:49
server backups, or you can schedule a single backup.<br>
00:53
In this case, we're going to just choose Backup Once.
00:56
However, a good disaster recovery
00:58
program would do regular backups.
01:00
We'll click backup once since were not scheduling a backup.
01:03
Since we have not created any scheduled backups
01:05
before, you must click different options.<br>
01:08
Let's go ahead and click Custom.
01:12
Click Next, we're going to click add items
01:18
and we're going to select the System State.<br>
01:21
Bare Metal Recovery, will backup all
01:23
the critical volumes on the computer.
01:25
It will backup the operating system and all the data
01:27
volumes if you are doing a bare metal recovery, also
01:30
sometimes known as an all critical backup, the backup can't
01:33
be saved on any of the volumes that are being backed up.
01:36
As well with the system state backup, we
01:38
can't save the backup on the C drive because
01:41
that's where the system state exists.<br>
01:43
So the system state includes the registry
01:45
key files, Active Directory and the SYSVOL.
01:48
We need to have some other place to store this backup.
01:51
I've connected an external drive to this
01:53
system currently, so I'm going to click OK.<br>
01:55
Click next and you actually also have the
01:57
ability to save things to remote share folders.
02:00
If you have some shared storage on your network,
02:02
you could actually go save your backup there.<br>
02:04
We're going to select a local drive since it's
02:07
a drive I have plugged into this local machine.
02:09
It's my F drive labeled Backup.
02:11
We're going to click Next, and Backup.
02:18
Okay, so once this backup finishes, which it
02:21
will take a while, we'll have a good backup
02:23
of our active directory and the SYSVOL.<br>
02:26
If we need to restore, we can come back to this
02:28
backup later to restore the main domain controller.<br>
3. Summary
02:31
In this demonstration we installed Windows server backup on
02:34
your Windows Server and then backed up our domain controller.<br>
