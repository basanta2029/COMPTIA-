1. Forensic Data Integrity and Preservation
00:04
Data integrity and preservation are fundamental
00:06
aspects of digital forensics, ensuring the
00:09
reliability and usefulness of the data.
00:12
They serve to maintain and protect the original
00:14
state of digital evidence from the moment of
00:17
collection to its presentation in court.
00:19
Any intentional or unintentional alteration can
00:22
compromise the accuracy of the evidence, thereby
00:25
undermining the entire forensic investigation.
00:28
This means that evidence acquisition, imaging, and
00:31
storage all need to be done using well-defined processes.<br>
2. Order of Volatility
00:35
Evidence should be captured in the order of
00:37
volatility, from more volatile to less volatile.
00:42
The ISOC best practice guide to evidence collection
00:45
and archiving recommends the following order: First,
00:48
CPU registers and cache memoryâ€”including cache on
00:52
disk controllers, graphics cards, etc.
00:55
The contents of nonpersistent system
00:56
memory, or RAM, including routing table, ARP
01:00
cache, process table, and kernel statistics.
01:04
Then, data is stored on persistent mass storage devices like
01:07
HDDs, SSDs, and flash memory devices, followed by partition
01:12
and file system blocks, slack space, and free space.<br>
01:17
Next would be system memory caches, such as swap
01:19
space, virtual memory, and hibernation files.
01:23
And finally, user, application,
01:25
and OS files and directories.
01:28
Other sources could include remote logging and
01:30
monitoring data, physical configuration and network
01:34
topology, and archival media or printed documents.<br>
3. Acquisition Integrity
01:39
Data acquisition is complicated by the fact that
01:41
it's more difficult to capture evidence from a
01:43
digital crime scene than it is from a physical one.
01:47
For example, some evidence could be lost if a computer
01:49
system is powered off; on the other hand, other evidence may
01:52
be unobtainable until after the system has been powered off.
01:56
Because of this, it's important to know the
01:58
three states for persistent storage acquisition.<br>
02:02
Live acquisition means copying the
02:04
data while the host is still running.
02:06
This may capture more evidence or more data for
02:09
analysis and reduce the impact on overall services.
02:12
Still, the data on the actual disks will have changed, so
02:16
this method may not produce legally acceptable evidence.
02:20
It may also alert the threat actor and allow
02:22
time for them to perform anti-forensics.<br>
02:25
With static acquisition, the host is shut down normally.
02:29
If malware is a concern, this method runs the risk that
02:32
the malware will detect the shutdown process and perform
02:35
anti-forensics to try to remove traces of itself.<br>
02:39
If this is the case, static acquisition by pulling
02:42
the plug instead of powering down may be a solution.
02:45
This means disconnecting the power at the wall
02:47
socket (not the hardware power-off button).
02:49
This is most likely to preserve the storage
02:52
devices in a forensically clean state, but
02:55
there's the risk of corrupting data.<br>
4. Proof of Integrity
02:58
Once the target disk has been safely attached to the
03:00
forensics workstation, data acquisition proceeds as follows:<br>
03:05
A cryptographic hash of the source disk media is
03:07
made using either the MD5 or SHA hashing function.
03:13
A bit-by-bit copy of the source media
03:14
is made using an imaging utility.
03:17
A second hash is then made of the image, which
03:19
should match the original hash of the media.
03:23
A copy is made of the reference image,
03:24
validated again by the checksum.
03:27
All analysis is performed on the copy.<br>
03:29
This proof of integrity ensures non-repudiation.
03:33
If the provenance of the evidence is certain,
03:36
the threat actor identified by analysis of the
03:38
evidence can't deny their actions.
03:41
The hashes prove that no modification
03:43
has been made to the image.<br>
5. Summary
03:45
That's it for this lesson.
03:47
In this lesson, we discussed
03:48
data integrity and preservation.
03:50
We reviewed the order of volatility that
03:52
requires that evidence be captured in order of
03:55
volatility from more volatile to less volatile.
03:58
We also talked about ensuring acquisition integrity by
04:02
leveraging the different states of persistent storage
04:04
acquisition: live acquisition, static acquisition,
04:08
powered down, and static acquisition, unplugged.
04:12
Lastly, we discussed how proof of evidence
04:13
integrity helps to ensure non-repudiation.<br>
