1. Create a Forensic Drive Image with Guymager
00:04
There are several ways to capture a disk
00:06
image as part of a forensic investigation.
00:09
In this demo, we're going to do
00:10
this with a program called Guymager.
00:11
Guymager has a graphical user interface, making
00:15
it a bit easier to use than a command line tool.
00:19
We're on the Guymager home page, and
00:20
you can read more about it there.
00:22
One thing I want to point out on the website
00:24
is that Guymager does come on several live
00:27
CDs and security operating systems.
00:30
We're going to use Kali Linux for our demo,
00:32
so let's close the browser and get started.
2. Write Blocker and Linux Version
00:35
I want to mention a couple of things before we get started.
00:39
Normally, you'll want to have a write blocker
00:41
between the disk you're imaging and the
00:43
forensic workstation that you're working from.
00:46
In a virtual environment, such as my
00:48
test system here, I can't really do that.
00:50
The write blocker would keep data from being written to
00:53
the disk we're wanting to image, which is very important.
00:57
The other thing I want to point out is that
00:59
Kali has a live CD version that has a lot of
01:02
forensic tools that my copy doesn't have.
01:04
Keep that in mind if you're setting up your
01:06
own lab and be sure to investigate the right
01:09
copy of Linux that will work best for you.
3. Launch Guymager
01:11
I said that Guymager is a GUI tool, but
01:14
it does need to be run as a Sudo user.
01:16
There's a shortcut for it under the Application
01:18
Launcher, so if I go up here, down to Forensics, and
01:22
then over to Forensic Imaging Tools, I see Guymager.
01:28
When it launches, it warns me that it needs to be started
01:30
with root rights in order to perform acquisitions.
01:33
That's no fun, and but we can get around it.
01:36
I'll launch it from the terminal.
01:38
So let's click No, I don't want to continue here.
01:42
I'll go up here and launch a terminal window.
01:44
After it loads, I'll type —˜sudo guymager' and press Enter.
01:48
It prompts me for a password to continue
01:51
as an admin, so I'll type that in here.
01:54
Just a reminder, when you type passwords
01:56
in Linux, the cursor doesn't move, and
01:58
you think that you're not really typing.
02:00
This is normal; it's a security feature.
02:02
Your keyboard isn't broken.
02:04
I press Enter, Guymager is launched,
02:06
and now I can acquire images.
4. Acquire an Image
02:11
I'll make this full screen to
02:12
take advantage of all the space.
02:14
Right away, I notice I have three disks, or partitions.
02:17
This first one is my hard drive for my Kali machine.
02:21
I know that because it's a 20-gig
02:22
disk, and that's what I used.
02:25
This second one is what I'm after.
02:27
I know this is it because it's a
02:28
2-gig disk, which I plugged in.
02:31
To acquire an image, I simply right-click
02:33
and choose Acquire Image from the menu.
02:36
Now we have a few choices for the file format.
02:39
This one is called Expert Witness Format.
02:41
When we select it, we have the option to fill
02:44
out all this additional data that would be needed
02:47
if this was part of a legal investigation.
02:49
We're not going to pick that one.
02:50
We're going to pick the Linux dd raw image.
02:53
This is the format I'm going to use when
02:55
it's time to examine the image content.
02:57
Over here, we can split the file into smaller pieces.
03:01
I have a smaller drive, so I could uncheck
03:03
that box, but I'll just leave it as-is.
03:06
Now I need to put the images somewhere.
03:08
I have a temp folder for these images, and I'll navigate to
03:12
/home/dana/temp and click Choose to select that directory.
03:18
I need to supply a filename, so I'll just enter —˜Image1'.
03:21
The program puts in the extension,
03:23
so we don't have to do that.
03:25
Below here, I'm going to make sure this box is checked so
03:28
that we have the hash value of the image Calculate MD5.
03:32
We're also going to verify the image after acquisition.
03:37
Click Start to get the process going.
03:39
We have a very small drive, so this shouldn't take long.
03:42
In fact, if you look at the progress, you
03:44
can see we're moving along very nicely.
03:46
It looks like it's finished, and
03:48
the indicator light is green.
03:50
We're done with this part, so let's verify
03:52
that it acquired the images and saved.
03:54
I'll minimize Guymager for now.
5. Verify Image Creation
03:57
Now let's go up to our Application
03:59
Launcher and open up File Manager.
04:04
Remember, we saved the image in a temp
04:06
directory under /home/dana, and here it is.
04:10
I'll slide the mouse over and double-click
04:12
on temp to open it and view the contents.
04:15
I can see three files.
04:17
It does look like Guymager broke my file into two,
04:20
since I checked the box to split files over 2 gigs.
04:23
The third file is a log file.
04:25
Let's open up that log and take a look.
6. Log File
04:28
My log file has some info about Guymager
04:30
itself--the version, timestamp, and so on.
04:34
I'll scroll down here a little ways.
04:36
Now I see some information about disk size and other data.
04:40
I want to go down a little farther, to here.
04:43
This is more relevant information
04:45
about the acquisition of the disk.
04:47
I have the device name, /dev/sda,
04:50
and the size, format, and so on.
04:52
Down here, I can see the MD5 hash calculation.
04:59
Finally, here, we can see when the image was
05:01
captured, how long it took, and the speed.
05:04
At the very bottom, we can see the three files
05:07
that were created when we ran the program.
05:09
At this point, our disk is captured.
05:12
The next step is to examine the contents with
05:14
another forensic software tool designed to do so.
7. Summary
05:18
That's it for this demo.
05:19
In this demo, we used Guymager to capture a drive.
