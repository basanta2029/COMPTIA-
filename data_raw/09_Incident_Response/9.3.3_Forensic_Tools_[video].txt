1. Forensic Tools
00:04
In this lesson, we're going to discuss
00:06
some of the forensic tools on the market.
00:08
Some of the tools are Linux-specific,
00:11
and other others are Windows-centric.
2. Forensics Tools
00:12
Investigating and gathering evidence for court
00:14
action is part of handling computer security.
00:17
These computer forensic investigations require
00:20
specialized tools to gather evidence without making
00:23
changes to the devices or their stored data.
00:26
These tools include imaging software, data
00:28
extraction tools, and advanced search capabilities.
3. Data Gathering Tools
00:31
Let's take a look at three of these tools and how they work.
00:35
We're going to talk about dd-CLI, Memdump, and WinHex.
00:39
The first tool, dd, is an extraction tool.
00:43
It's one of the oldest forensic tools still in use.
00:46
It's used in Linux and Unix systems to
00:48
create bit-by-bit copies of a physical hard
00:50
drive without mounting the drive beforehand.
00:53
It uses the dd-CLI command, and it's easy to employ.
00:57
A raw image is created for forensic analysis,
01:00
and the user has multiple file extension choices.
01:03
Memdump is another data gathering tool.
01:06
It aggregates the data in the
01:08
volatile RAM memory from devices.
01:10
Normally, a second tool is needed to search
01:12
through all the data in a memdump file.
01:15
WinHex is a powerful disk and universal hexadecimal editor.
01:20
It's used in digital forensics for data recovery.
01:22
WinHex is Windows-compatible and can be used with a whole
01:26
bunch of options, making it a very versatile forensic tool.
4. Imaging and Investigation
01:30
Now let's move on to imaging tools.
01:32
Imaging tools must create exact copies of data
01:35
without making a single change—not even one bit.
01:39
FTK Imager is a powerful tool that allows
01:41
the investigator to acquire, preview, and
01:44
copy data thoroughly and forensically.
01:46
Autopsy is exactly what it sounds like—a forensic
01:50
tool that investigators use to thoroughly examine
01:52
extracted data, pictures, and empty disk space in
01:55
order to determine exactly what happened.
5. Summary
01:58
And that's it for this lesson.
02:00
We talked about Forensics tools and how they fall within
02:02
a few categories; data gathering, imaging, and extraction.
02:07
We discussed what forensic tools must be able to do--create
02:10
an exact image of a disk with perfect integrity and then
02:14
search large amounts of data for specific file extensions,
02:17
hidden files, deleted data, and root cause analysis.
