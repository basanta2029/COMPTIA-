1. Incident Response
00:04
Incident response is a systematic approach to
00:06
handling and managing the aftermath of a security
00:09
breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT
00:12
incident, computer incident, or security incident.
00:16
The goal is to handle the situation in a way that
00:18
limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.<br>
2. Incident Response Lifecycle
00:22
The incident response lifecycle provides a
00:24
structured approach to addressing and managing the
00:27
aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack to
00:30
limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs.
00:33
The incident response lifecycle includes seven
00:36
steps: preparation, detection, analysis, containment,
00:41
eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.<br>
3. Preparation
00:45
Part of the preparation step is to ensure
00:47
that systems are resilient to attack.
00:50
This includes hardening systems, writing
00:52
policies and procedures, and setting up
00:54
confidential lines of communication.<br>
00:57
The preparation step also includes creating
00:59
incident response resources and procedures.
01:02
An Incident Response Plan is like
01:04
a fire drill for cyber threats.
01:06
Just as a fire drill outlines steps to evacuate a
01:09
building safely, an Incident Response Plan contains
01:12
instructions on how to react when a cyber-attack occurs.<br>
4. Detection
01:17
The detection step discovers
01:19
indicators of threat actor activity.
01:21
Indicators that an incident may have occurred
01:24
could be generated from an automated intrusion
01:26
system or other monitoring and alerting systems.
01:30
Incidents can also be detected using threat hunting
01:33
methods or by reports made by employees or customers.<br>
5. Containment
01:37
The containment phase is where immediate action is taken
01:41
to prevent further damage or compromise of the system.
01:44
This could involve disconnecting affected systems or devices
01:47
from the network to prevent the spread of the breach.
01:50
It's the equivalent of stopping the
01:52
bleeding in a medical emergency, a quick and
01:54
temporary fix to halt the immediate threat.
01:57
Containment strategies can vary based on
01:59
the severity and nature of the incident.
02:02
After containment, an in-depth investigation
02:04
leads to the next phaseâ€”eradication.<br>
6. Recovery
02:08
Next is the recovery phase.
02:10
During this phase, systems and networks
02:12
are returned to their normal function.
02:14
All systems affected by the cyberattack are
02:16
cleaned, restored, and put back into operation.
02:20
Recovery may involve reinstalling system components,
02:23
changing passwords, and patching software.
02:26
System administrators should carefully monitor
02:28
systems during recovery for any signs of abnormal
02:31
activity, as this could indicate that not all
02:34
threat elements have been successfully eradicated.
02:37
Regular operations can resume once the systems
02:39
are deemed secure and functioning normally.
02:42
The recovery phase isn't considered complete until all
02:45
systems are back operational and all data has been recovered.<br>
7. Lessons Learned
02:49
The last phase in the incident response
02:51
lifecycle is the "lessons learned" stage.
02:54
During this phase, the incident response
02:56
team conducts a post-incident review.
02:59
This review aims to identify what went well during the
03:02
response, what could've been done better, and what
03:04
improvements can be made to the incident response process.
03:08
It provides an opportunity to learn from the
03:10
incident and improve future response efforts.
03:13
The lessons learned may include changes to
03:15
policies, procedures, or infrastructure.
03:18
They may lead to further security
03:20
and awareness training for employees.<br>
8. Summary
03:23
That's it for this lesson.
03:24
In this lesson, we've discussed incident response.
03:27
We looked at the seven steps of the incident response
03:30
lifecycle: preparation, detection, analysis,
03:34
containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.<br>
