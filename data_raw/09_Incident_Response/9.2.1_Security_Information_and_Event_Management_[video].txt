1. SIEM
00:04
In this video, we'll discuss Security Information and Event
00:08
Management, or SIEM, which is a tool used to compile and
00:11
examine multiple data points gathered from across a network.
00:14
We'll also explore log management.<br>
2. Vulnerability Scan Output
00:17
Monitoring a network requires experience and solid tools.
00:21
One common network security tool is a scanner that can
00:23
identify vulnerabilities and recommend remediation steps.
00:27
The scan delivers output information to the
00:29
IT administrators via the SIEM dashboard.
00:32
The interval between scans is set by the IT department.
00:36
This tool also scans servers, firewalls,
00:38
switches, software programs, and even
00:41
security cameras and wireless access points.<br>
3. SIEM Dashboards
00:43
There are many versions of SIEMs.
00:46
Each one has different features and benefits,
00:48
but all SIEMs have several features in common.
00:50
One of these is the dashboard.
00:52
These are generally customizable information screens
00:55
that show real-time security and network information.
00:59
This allows the IT security team to monitor
01:01
events as they occur on the network.<br>
01:04
Sensors play a vital role in
01:05
monitoring and securing a network.
4. Sensors
01:08
These sensors are set up at critical endpoints,
01:10
services, and other vulnerable locations.
01:13
They're programmed to send customized alerts to the
01:15
SEIM if certain parameters are reached or exceeded.<br>
01:19
Before sensors are deployed, the IT
01:21
security team sets their sensitivity.
5. Sensitivity
01:23
The benefit to variable sensitivity settings is the
01:27
ability to customize the data that's sent to the SIEM.
01:30
Not every company has the same needs, and that's what
01:32
makes sensor-sensitivity customization so beneficial.<br>
01:37
Trends are patterns of activity
01:38
discovered and reported to the SEIM.
6. Trends
01:41
This is how baselines are established.
01:42
These trends help security analysts decide if reported
01:46
activity is normal or outside of the baseline.
01:49
Trends that don't fit previously
01:50
recorded ones can be investigated.
01:53
As the IT security team investigates and documents
01:56
these trends, it becomes easier for them to quickly
01:59
spot an anomaly that may signal a security concern.<br>
02:02
Alerts are the SIEMs' way of letting the IT team know
02:05
that a pre-established parameter has been contravened.
7. Alerts
02:08
The alert is intended to get the attention of
02:11
the IT person who's monitoring the network.
02:14
A best practice in this area is 24-hour monitoring.
02:18
This means that weekends, holidays,
02:20
and early hours are all filled.
02:21
Hackers don't keep normal hours, and network
02:24
equipment can break at the most inconvenient times!<br>
02:27
Event correlation is a critical
02:28
part of using a SIEM solution.
8. Correlation
02:30
The software gathers data from log files,
02:33
system applications, network appliances,
02:36
and other endpoints in order to analyze it.
02:39
This work is tedious, and people are inefficient at it.
02:42
That's why the event-correlation feature is valuable.
02:45
Not only does it gather data, but it analyzes
02:47
and compares known malicious behavior against
02:49
the aggregate data so that events aren't missed.<br>
02:53
That's it for this lesson.
9. Summary
02:55
In this lesson, we learned about SIEMs and the
02:57
features that make them a critical network component.
02:59
These include customizable sensors and their placement.
03:03
Trends help IT teams to establish
03:05
baselines or norms for their network.
03:07
Alerts provide critical information to the network
03:10
monitor so that appropriate action can be taken.
03:13
Event correlation automates a very laborious
03:16
process and analyzes and compares aggregate
03:19
data to known security behaviors and events,
03:22
ensuring that nothing gets by undetected.
03:24
All this is delivered to the IT team via a
03:27
customizable dashboard for easy examination.<br>
