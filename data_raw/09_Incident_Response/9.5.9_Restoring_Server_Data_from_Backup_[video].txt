1. Restore Server Data from Backup
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll explore the
00:07
process of recovering user data on a server.<br>
2. Use Windows Server Backup
00:10
In our File Explorer window, let's navigate
00:12
to the Desktop, where we can find the Shares
00:14
folder that we previously created.<br>
00:16
Now, let's delete this folder, making it disappear.
00:19
However, imagine that later on, we realize we need it back.
00:23
To retrieve it, we'll have to restore it from a backup.
00:26
To initiate this process, let's go
00:27
to Tools &gt; Windows Server Backup.<br>
00:33
In the Messages Box, we can see
00:35
the available backup options.
00:37
Let's click on the one we want to
00:38
use and review its information.
00:40
Once we're satisfied, click OK.
00:42
Next, we'll click on "Recover" and then proceed with "Next."<br>
00:46
Here, we can verify our selection
00:47
to ensure it's the correct backup.
00:49
Since it's the only one available,
00:51
let's proceed by clicking "Next."<br>
00:54
Note that we have several recovery options.
00:56
We can recover files or folders, and if this were a Hyper-V
01:00
Server, we could recover an entire virtual machine if needed.
01:04
It's also possible to recover entire volumes.<br>
01:07
Now, let's talk about applications recovery.
01:10
If you have backed up a server with installed applications
01:13
like Exchange or SharePoint, you can restore the entire
01:16
application without having to reinstall it from scratch.
01:20
However, you only need to recover the data in this case.
01:23
This can be useful for transferring an application
01:26
from one server to another using the backup.<br>
01:29
The last option is to recover specific files and folders.
01:33
Let's click "Next."<br>
01:34
So, we'll navigate to the specific
01:36
folder we want to recover.<br>
01:38
After selecting it, click "Next," and then
01:40
choose to restore it to the original location.
01:43
Although you have the option to save it
01:45
elsewhere, we want it back in its original place.<br>
01:49
Now, let's create copies of both
01:50
versions just as a precautionary measure.
01:53
There are several reasons not
01:54
to overwrite existing versions.<br>
3. Recover Files
01:56
If you're restoring a file that someone claims is
01:59
missing, and they provide the wrong filename, you could
02:02
accidentally overwrite a file they intended to keep.
02:05
This could lead to future problems.<br>
4. Create Copies
02:07
It's a wise practice to create copies to
02:09
avoid data loss or accidental overwrites.
02:12
In such cases, you'd have to go
02:14
back and recover even more data.
02:16
Let's proceed by selecting "Next" and then "Recover."<br>
02:19
Now, it confirms that the process is complete.
02:25
Let's close and minimize the windows.
02:28
You can now see that the folder has been
02:29
successfully restored to its original location.<br>
5. Summary
02:32
In this demonstration, we walked you through the process of
02:35
restoring data using Windows Server 2022 Backup, illustrating
02:39
how to utilize Windows Restore Data effectively.<br>
