1. Examine a Forensic Drive Image with Autopsy
00:04
After a computer forensic investigator captures
00:06
an image of a drive, they need to examine it.
00:09
Autospy is a popular examination tool.
00:11
It's digital forensic software that's free, open
00:14
source, and said to have most of the features that
00:16
you'd find in commercial digital forensics tools.
00:19
Some of the features include, hash matching,
00:22
registry analysis, and web analytics, and the
00:24
ability to do a keyword search.
00:27
For our demo, we're going to use Autopsy to analyze a disk
00:30
that has been previously captured and saved to my hard drive.
2. Add Data Source
00:34
Double-click on it to start it.
00:35
Sometimes it takes a minute or so for it to fully launch.
00:39
We want to create a new case.
00:41
Click on that option.
00:42
We'll give it a case name, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'.
00:44
Let's specify the directory where we're going
00:49
to store the information we're about to create.
00:52
Let's put it in the same directory as our image file.
00:54
We'll keep all the data together.
00:56
I'll actually create a folder for it and name it —˜Autopsy'.
01:01
I'll select the folder we just created and then click Next.
01:04
Enter in a case number, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'.
01:08
I'll put the examiner's name in here.
01:10
I'll hit Finish.
01:12
This next part is going to take a minute or two
01:13
while it creates the case and gathers all the files.
01:16
I'll pause the demo while this is running.
01:19
Okay, that took several minutes, and now
01:21
I'm presented with the Add Data Source page.
01:24
We have to specify what we want to analyze.
01:26
We're going to analyze a disk image or VM file.
01:30
Click Next.
01:31
We need to specify what image file we want to look at.
01:34
It's in a folder called Forensic
01:36
Images under 1 2 3 4 Mary Worley.
01:40
There's the image file that we created a minute ago.
01:42
Hit Open.
01:43
We need to set our time zone.
01:45
I'm in Mountain Time, so I'll scroll
01:47
down until I find that and select it.
01:50
Click Next.
01:51
We have to specify exactly what we want to look for.
01:56
This tool uses what's called Ingest Modules.
01:59
An ingest module is basically just a piece of software that
02:02
looks for a particular type of information in the image file.
02:06
You can come over here and
02:07
specify what you want to look for.
02:09
For example, you could go under Keyword
02:11
Search and specify what type of information
02:14
you want that particular module to look for.
02:17
We want to look for all of this information
02:19
here, so I'll check all the boxes and click Next.
02:23
Now let's go ahead and click Finish.
02:26
The process of analyzing the image file has started.
02:29
It can take quite some time to complete,
02:31
depending on the size of disk and amount of data.
02:34
In my test environment, I don't have a very large disk
02:37
or very much data, so it should happen pretty quickly.
02:40
But I'll go ahead and pause the demo while it runs.
3. Identify Suspect Content
02:43
At this point, the image file has been thoroughly
02:45
examined by the Autopsy tool, and the results are
02:48
displayed here on the left, organized by the type of
02:51
data or the view of the data that you want to use.
02:53
It's very useful.
02:54
For example, it sorts the data by the file type extension.
02:58
Let's click on Images.
03:00
There are 43 of them.
03:01
Let's see what we have.
03:04
If I click this one, WACC classroom.jpg, I can
03:07
see the image down here, in a preview pane.
03:09
It looks like a picture of a computer lab or classroom.
03:14
See this one up here, with the red X?
03:16
This is a file that was deleted on the hard drive.
03:19
Of course, as you probably know, when you delete
03:22
something, you don't actually delete it at all--you
03:24
just delete the pointer, or reference to it.
03:27
The file won't go away until the
03:28
drive is formatted or overwritten.
03:31
Even then, files are sometimes recoverable.
03:33
Down in the preview, this looks
03:35
like a screen shot of something.
03:37
I'll click on Videos.
03:38
Over in the listing, I have four videos.
03:40
One's been deleted.
03:41
When I click on Audio, my list is the same as it
03:46
was for videos, so Autopsy must recognize that
03:49
there are audio files as part of the videos.
03:52
Under Documents, I have some Microsoft Office documents.
03:56
I could export those out and look at the contents
03:58
in the supported programs if I wanted to.
04:01
I have a few PDF documents as well,
04:03
along with some plain text files.
04:05
Once again, a few of these have been
04:07
deleted, as you can see by the red X.
04:12
I have no executable files to look at, so we'll skip those.
04:16
Autopsy does give us a list of just the
04:18
deleted files, all grouped together.
04:20
That is handy if I was focused just on what Mary
04:23
may have deleted and might be trying to hide.
04:25
I have a few more categories.
04:27
We have Recycle Bin and something
04:29
called User Content Suspected.
04:32
I'll make my way down to the email addresses.
04:34
Out of concern for confidentiality, I'm not going to open
04:37
this up because I'm not sure exactly what's on this disk.
04:41
Just to clarify, when we see things like emails
04:43
addresses, IP addresses, URLs, and so on, it does not mean
04:48
email accounts configured on the system, but any email
04:51
that shows up on the disk in a document, spreadsheet, etc.
04:56
Under IP addresses, I see 0.1.2.3.
05:00
This might be a simple false positive because
05:02
the format is somewhat like an IP address.
05:09
Under phone numbers, I have some
05:10
phony-looking phone numbers.
05:12
This looks like something from
05:13
TV, since they have a 555 prefix.
05:19
I have a bunch of URLs listed.
05:21
This is handy for seeing where the person
05:23
has been spending their time on the web.
05:25
I have Hashset Hits, but there's nothing there to see.
05:28
Right under this, I actually have Email Messages,
05:31
but there aren't any to look at on this disk.
05:34
I have Credit Cards down here.
05:35
Once again, I'm not going to click on those and
05:37
open them because I'm not sure what I might find.
05:40
And now we're at the bottom of the list.
4. Additional Features
05:43
Now, there are entire courses and degree
05:45
programs on how to use this product and the
05:48
whole legal process that goes along with it.
05:50
This demo is a very brief overview of
05:53
what the software is capable of doing.
05:55
We didn't even look at things such as
05:57
geolocation, timeline, report generation, or
06:00
other features—"there's a lot more to learn!
5. Summary
06:03
That's it for this demonstration.
06:04
In this demo, we used Autopsy to examine a disk image.
