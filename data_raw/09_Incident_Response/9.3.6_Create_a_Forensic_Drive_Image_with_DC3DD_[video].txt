1. Create Forensic Disk Image with DC3DD
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going
00:06
to create a forensic drive image.
00:08
It's very important that you understand
00:10
you can't use standard file copying
00:12
utilities to create a forensic drive image.
00:15
You can't use, say, Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
00:19
Those utilities copy files that have an entry, a
00:22
record, in the allocation table of the partition
00:24
where it resides, so it only copies data that's
00:27
associated with a file or folder in the file system.
00:31
When you're conducting a forensic investigation, you
00:33
need all the data on that hard drive, especially the data
00:36
that's not associated with a particular file or file in
00:39
the file system, but is still on the hard disk drive.
00:41
Basically, we're looking for stuff that's been
00:43
deleted—"stuff that someone may be trying to hide.
00:46
We need to use a drive imaging utility to do this.
00:50
There are a variety of utilities that you can use.
00:52
Some cost a lot of money; some cost practically nothing.
00:56
We're going to use the latter
00:57
option in this demonstration today.
00:59
In this demo, we'll use dc3dd to
01:02
obtain a raw image of a hard drive.
01:05
dc3dd was developed at the Department of
01:07
Defense's Cyber Crime Center, and it's basically
01:10
an enhanced version of the open source dd command
01:13
with added features for computer forensics.
01:16
One of the main characteristics of dc3dd is that it
01:19
offers the possibility of hashing on the fly with
01:22
multiple algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512).
01:28
You'll want to use a write blocker between your
01:30
machine and the disk you're obtaining an image from.
2. Linux Storage Devices
01:32
Before we start looking at how to create the
01:36
drive image, you need to understand how Linux
01:38
storage devices are addressed by the Linux system.
01:41
It's kind of difficult to understand when you're new to
01:44
Linux, but all storage devices on Linux systems are
01:47
addressed using a device file located in the /dev directory.
01:52
If a process needs to write information to a hard disk
01:54
drive, it writes it to a specific file in the /dev
01:58
directory, which then redirects the IO data to the
02:00
appropriate hardware device, such as a hard disk drive.
02:04
What we need to do is figure out what the device
02:07
name is for the drive that we want to image.
02:09
There are a variety of command line
02:11
utilities you can use to do this.
02:13
One way to find the forensic image is to
02:15
use fdisk and the sudo fdisk 1 parameter.
3. Use fdisk to Identify Disks
02:20
I think we have enough information to get started.
02:22
We could go to a terminal and start dc3dd, but I'm going to
02:26
go up to the Application Launcher and start it from there.
02:29
I'll come down to Forensics and
02:30
then select Forensic Imaging Tools.
02:34
I see dc3dd, so let's click on it and launch it.
02:38
The only reason I wanted to start it this way
02:40
is so that you can see we have a nice manual
02:42
here to learn more about how to use it.
02:45
I'm not actually going to go over any of this
02:47
in this information right here, but I will
02:49
when we type some of the commands in a minute.
02:52
I'm going to type —˜clear' and
02:53
get a clean screen to work with.
02:55
I like to see what disks I have to work with by
02:58
typing —˜sudo fdisk' with the —˜-l' parameter.
03:01
Press Enter.
03:02
Now put in the sudo password.
03:06
The first disk we'll look at is this one, /dev/sdb.
03:08
It's a 20-gig disk, and I know that this
03:12
is the one with my Kali Linux installed on.
03:15
But this isn't the disk I want to image.
03:17
If I go up a little, I see a second disk, /dev/sda.
03:22
This one is 2 gigs.
03:24
This is the one I want to image.
03:26
Make sure you know which disk you're
03:27
working with when you do this.
03:29
I'll come down here and type —˜clear' to clear the screen.
4. Using the dc3dd Command to Create a Forensic Drive Image
03:32
Now we need to type in the command to create the
03:35
image, tell it where to find the disk, where to store
03:37
the copy, which hash to use, and name the log file.
03:41
I'll go ahead and type that in and then come
03:43
back in a second and explain the command.
03:46
Okay, I have the command typed in.
03:48
The first part is —˜sudo dc3dd'.
03:51
This just tells Linux to run our command as
03:53
root, or basically like an admin in Windows.
03:56
The next part, —˜if=/dev/sda', is my input file.
04:01
That's what the letters I-F stand for, input file.
04:05
After that, we need to specify where our image will go.
04:08
O-F stands for output file, so we've typed
04:11
in —˜of=/home/dana/temp/imaged2.img'.
04:17
That's the path where I'll save my image
04:19
file, and I named it —˜image2.img'.
04:22
Next, we'll use —˜hash=sha256' for our hash type.
04:26
We could use MD5 or one of the others types we listed
04:30
in the intro of this demo, but this will work fine.
04:33
The last thing we have is —˜log=/home/dana/temp/image2.log'.
04:35
As you can guess, this is just a log file, which is
04:43
very important to have along with the disk image.
04:46
It's going to be located in the
04:47
same directory as our disk image.
04:49
We'll look at after we create it.
04:52
This all looks really good.
04:53
I'll press Enter to start the disk imaging.
04:56
Down here, we can see the copy progress.
04:58
Keep in mind that this is a very small disk
05:01
without a lot of data, so it's going quickly.
05:09
It looks like it's done.
05:10
Down here, I can see when it completed.
05:13
Up here is the location of the image file.
05:15
I'll go up and close out of our terminal.
05:18
Now let's go look in our temp file, confirm
05:20
that it copied over, and look at our log file.
5. Verify Results
05:22
Next, we'll go up to Application
05:24
Launcher and over to File Manager.
05:27
I'll go over to my temp folder
05:29
and double-click on it to open it.
05:31
Here are my two files, my image file and my log file.
05:35
Let's open that log now.
05:36
It shows us things like the time the image started,
05:39
the size, where the file was located, our hash value,
05:43
the output filename, and the time it completed.
05:46
Our next step would be to use another
05:48
forensic tool to examine the image itself.
6. Summary
05:50
And that's it for this demo.
05:52
We used the command line utility dc3dd
05:55
to capture a forensic image from a disk.
