1. Log Management
00:04
In this video, we'll explore log categories,
00:06
specific logs you should know, and open-source
00:09
tools that are used to aid IT security teams.<br>
2. Network Logs
00:12
Every network generates dozens and dozens of logs.
00:15
Network logs tell us what's coming
00:17
into and leaving our network.
00:19
Every network appliance and almost every application
00:22
produces logs which can be used for a variety of reasons.
00:25
But more often than not, we use logs for network security.<br>
3. System Logs
00:29
System logs are produced by an operating system.
00:32
These logs contain all the information that
00:34
pertains to that OS like updates, errors,
00:37
failures, and other system occurrences.
00:40
This includes information for client computers
00:42
and servers, which gives IT admins a way to
00:45
investigate events on individual machines that may
00:48
interconnect with other machines on the network.<br>
4. Application Logs
00:51
Most applications produce some type of event logging.
00:55
These logs show application access, crashes,
00:57
updates, and any other relevant information which
01:00
could be valuable in determining root-cause analysis.
01:04
The application may be crashing or not performing
01:06
correctly, and this could be tied to suspicious
01:09
activity that may indicate malicious intent.<br>
5. Security Logs
01:12
There are several logs that would
01:13
fall under the security category.
01:15
There are application-security logs, event-security
01:18
logs, and security logs for specialty applications like
01:21
IDS/IPS, endpoints, firewalls, routers, and switches.
01:26
Also, logs for security cameras and wireless or physical
01:29
access points are included under the security log umbrella.<br>
6. Web Server Logs
01:34
There's no doubt that web server logs are
01:36
one of the most tedious of all logs to parse.
01:38
But web servers can be prime targets for hackers,
01:42
so it's important to know who's interacting with
01:44
your server and what they're attempting to do.
01:47
Most web engines like IIS, Tomcat, Web Sphere,
01:51
and NGINX have some level of server logging.
01:54
These logs can tell you exactly when users
01:56
log onto your site and what their location is.
01:59
They also give you some information on attempted attacks.<br>
7. DNS
02:03
Domain Name System, or DNS, has been around for a long time.
02:07
When DNS was designed, network security wasn't a priority.
02:11
Over time, malicious actors
02:12
started using DNS-targeted attacks.
02:15
These attacks have the potential to
02:16
be disruptive and quite expensive.
02:19
With DNS logging, you can track updates
02:21
and choose to approve or deny them.
02:23
DNS also produces query logs that detail which
02:26
requests are being handled by which instance.
02:29
Rate limiting is another valuable
02:30
tool that limits response rate.
02:33
Analyze these logs to see when rate
02:35
limiting was used and for what purpose.
02:37
Client IP, record requests, flags, and other
02:40
metadata can be included in these logs.<br>
8. Dump Files
02:43
Dump files are created when an application,
02:45
OS, or other computer function stops abruptly.
02:49
The information that's stored in memory at the
02:51
time is dropped into a file for later analysis.
02:54
These files help IT admins perform root-cause analysis
02:58
because they provide the state that the application was
03:00
in when it crashed, error codes, and other clues as to
03:04
what happened previous to the application failure.
03:07
They can also give clues as to the crash's origin.
03:10
This could be something as commonplace as a bad
03:12
driver or hardware component, or it may prove,
03:15
unfortunately, to be the result of a malicious act.<br>
9. Authentication Logs
03:19
Authentication logs are vital to a network's security.
03:22
Authentication servers may be Active Directory-based
03:25
or OpenLDAP depending on your network structure.
03:29
It's critical to know who may be poking around your
03:32
network, so token requests, authentication failures,
03:35
or failed logins on expired accounts are all stored
03:38
on these authentication logs for you to view.<br>
10. VoIP
03:41
Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP,
03:44
has become a common network application.
03:46
With a high implementation rate comes
03:48
attention from malicious actors.
03:50
As with any network application, there are
03:52
vulnerabilities that can be leveraged, so in order to
03:55
defend it there needs to be a way to access
03:57
information about what's happening at any given time.<br>
11. SIP Traffic
04:01
Session Initial Protocol, or SIP,
04:03
is the standard in VoIP calls.
04:05
The key to tracking attacks against a VoIP system is
04:08
understanding SIP and being able to parse its logs.
04:11
These logs contain key information about where a call
04:14
was initiated and what the communication's intent was.
04:18
These facts help the IT security team
04:20
create a stronger SIP security posture.<br>
12. Syslog/Rsyslog/Syslog-ng
04:22
Syslog is short for System Logging Protocol.
04:26
This protocol sends system logs and event messages
04:29
to a server designated by the system administrator.
04:32
It collects logs from various appliances and sends them to
04:35
the syslog server where they can be reviewed and analyzed.<br>
04:40
Rsyslog is an open-source tool
04:41
created for use in Linux networks.
04:43
It stands for rocket-fast system-log processing.
04:47
It gets its name because of its ability to send
04:48
a million messages per second to a local server.
04:52
This tool's benefit is its diversity.
04:55
It's capable of multi-threading by leveraging
04:57
multiple security protocols like TCP, TLS, and others.
05:01
It also allows for output-format customization.<br>
05:04
Syslog-ng is a robust log-aggregating software
05:09
for multiple platforms, including Windows.
05:12
This tool increases the quality of
05:14
the log data that's sent to your SIEM.
05:16
It also facilitates lightning-fast log searches
05:19
by using full-text queries and collects logs
05:22
without the installation of server agents.<br>
13. Journalctl
05:25
Journactl is a Linux tool that gathers the logs produced by
05:29
systemd, a system that's the basis for many Linux components.
05:33
This command is used in Bash to parse
05:36
logs that've been collected by systemd.
05:38
The results are presented in the syslog format
05:41
and are ordered oldest to newest by default.
05:44
This can be changed by using the â€“r flag.
05:46
Each line shows the date, server
05:48
hostname, process name, and any messages.
05:52
If you're more comfortable using a
05:54
command line tool, this is for you.
05:56
Because it's a CLI tool, there are many key commands
05:59
at your disposal to get you your logs quickly.<br>
14. Nxlog
06:03
Nxlog is an open-source log-collector application.
06:06
It uses log-collector agents to gather and send log data
06:09
to a log server, which can itself be set up using nxlog.
06:13
This application is available for both Windows and Linux.
06:16
The Community edition supports multiple SIEM applications
06:20
and works with Windows Event Viewer and syslog.<br>
15. Summary
06:23
That's it for this lesson.
06:25
In this lesson, we learned about different log categories
06:28
like network logs, security logs, and application logs.
06:31
We also learned about specific logs and
06:33
how you can use them for better security.
06:36
Finally, we learned about open-source tools that assist
06:39
you in collecting and organizing log data and metadata.
06:43
Understanding logs is truly the key to better security.<br>
