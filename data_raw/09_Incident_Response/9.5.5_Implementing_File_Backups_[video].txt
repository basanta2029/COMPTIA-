1. Create Backups in Windows
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to look at two ways
00:06
to back up files on a Windows systemâ€”using File History
00:09
and using the legacy Backup and Restore utility.<br>
2. File History
00:12
Let's take a look at setting up File History first.
00:15
File History saves copies of your files
00:17
so they can be recovered later if needed.
00:20
Using the Windows search button, I'll look
00:22
for file history and click to start it.
00:25
As you can see, it's currently turned off.
00:27
There's only one button to choose from.
00:29
Once it's turned on, you can select Run now to
00:32
start an immediate backup of the listed locations.
00:35
As you can see, the H: drive is
00:37
currently selected as the storage device.<br>
00:40
To the left, additional options are available.
00:43
In addition to the Restore personal files
00:44
option, which is used for retrieving copies after
00:47
they've been backed up, there's Select drive.
00:50
When clicked, the available devices are listed.
00:53
In this case, only the H: drive is available.
00:56
There's also an option to add a network location.<br>
00:59
Another important setting is Exclude folders.
01:02
Currently, the Pictures library is
01:04
excluded from copies being kept.
01:06
The Add and Remove buttons can be used to change this list.
01:10
In Advanced settings, we can change how often
01:12
copies are made and how many versions to keep.
01:15
The defaults are Every hour and Forever, respectively.<br>
3. Backup and Restore (Windows 7)
01:19
The legacy Backup and Restore tool is designed to hold
01:22
copies of data or an entire system as a disk image.
01:26
It's recommended that the device holding
01:28
the backups be external, or at least on a
01:30
different storage device than the C: drive.
01:32
In this case, I have a second device prepared.
01:35
I'll browse to the Backup and Restore
01:37
utility found under Control Panel.
01:39
The tool's full name is Backup and Restore (Windows 7)
01:42
since this is a legacy tool from the Windows 7 days.
01:46
Once launched, I'll select Set up backup
01:49
and then select the appropriate device.
01:51
The H: drive is the device I intend to perform
01:54
backups to, so I don't need to make any changes.
01:57
I could, if necessary, click on the Save on a network
01:59
button and browse to a shared location for storage.
02:03
I'll leave it as the H: drive and click Next.<br>
02:06
At this point, the system wants me to
02:08
choose which files and folders to back up.
02:10
Since the default settings are good for our purposes in this
02:13
demo, I'll leave it on Let Windows choose and click Next.
02:17
On the next screen, we see a review of the options
02:20
we've selected and a new Change schedule link.
02:23
Currently, the backup is run on Sunday
02:25
at 7:00 PM, which is good for our needs.
02:27
To finish the configuration, we
02:29
click Save settings and run backup.<br>
4. Summary
02:32
That's it for this demonstration on backups.
02:34
We covered two ways to back up files.
02:36
First, we looked at backing up using File History, and then
02:40
we looked at the legacy Windows 7 Backup and Restore utility.<br>
