1. Monitoring Data and Metadata
00:04
In this lesson, we'll cover the use of
00:06
bandwidth monitors and metadata from emails,
00:09
mobile devices, web traffic, and files.
00:12
We'll also talk about using netflow/sflow echo and Ipfix.
00:18
Let's get started.
2. Bandwidth Monitors
00:20
Bandwidth monitors are a type of application that
00:22
help network admins understand bandwidth usage.
00:26
The first order of business with these
00:27
applications is to establish a baseline.
00:31
The longer a monitor runs, the more data points are created.
00:34
When a substantial number of data points are
00:36
created, a normal usage becomes apparent.
00:40
Normal bandwidth usage is relative and varies by hours in
00:43
the day, days of the week, and even weeks within the year.
00:47
A baseline provides something concrete to compare
00:50
against current usage or even suspect bandwidth usage.
00:54
There are many bandwidth monitoring applications available.
00:57
There are cloud-based apps, on-premise
01:00
apps, open source, and paid.
01:03
Each one looks and functions differently,
01:05
but each has the same goal, which is to
01:07
allow easy access to bandwidth monitoring.
01:10
The key is to learn how to establish a
01:12
monitoring schedule and how to use the dashboard.
01:16
Here, we have some screenshots of
01:18
different pages within a dashboard.
01:20
As you can see, this graphic is showing bandwidth usage
01:24
be the hour and below usage per day aggregated over time.
01:28
This is the baseline that suspect usage is compared against.
01:33
The second graphic shows the last hour's usage
01:36
and the usage for a user-specified time frame.
01:39
This allows for deeper examination
01:41
of suspect bandwidth usage.
3. Email Metadata
01:44
Email is a great tool that almost
01:46
everyone uses to communicate.
01:48
It's also the avenue for the majority
01:50
of malicious network breaches.
01:52
Fortunately, email provides metadata so it can be traced.
01:56
All emails come with a header that contains
01:59
information about both the sender and recipient.
02:02
Parts of the headers can be spoofed to
02:04
give investigators false information.
02:06
The good news is that there are security devices
02:09
that put X-headers throughout an emails' headers.
02:12
These provide the originating email account
02:15
and IP address, not the spoofed one.
4. Mobile Metadata
02:18
Communications sent via mobile devices are common today.
02:22
They come from tablets, laptops, smart
02:24
phones, smart watches, and any other portable
02:27
device that connects to the internet.
02:29
These devices send emails and text messages
02:32
and use apps to allow data and photo sharing.
02:35
All this data produces metadata that can be used to
02:38
identify people, places, times, and even deleted data.
02:43
Pictures can be time stamped and geolocation stamped.
02:47
Much of this metadata also reveals the
02:49
origination of the data and the sender.
5. Web Metadata
02:52
Websites produce many types of metadata.
02:55
In fact, the metadata on a user's machine
02:57
versus the server can be very different.
03:00
The data on the opposite side of the
03:02
transmission can help fill in gaps and
03:04
corroborate findings on the opposing machine.
03:08
Metadata includes IP addresses, user requests,
03:11
user downloads, time spent on the site, and
03:14
even attempts to gain unauthorized access.
03:18
Web metadata also includes cookies,
03:20
browser history, and even cached pages.
03:23
Many times, malicious actors will
03:25
attempt to obfuscate their real metadata.
03:28
But the good news is that there are ways of finding the real
03:31
metadata, especially for trained forensic investigators.
6. File Metadata
03:35
Files produce many types of metadata.
03:37
The first kind is File Creation (date/time).
03:42
The File Creation data is the first time the file
03:44
was written to the storage media it's currently on.
03:47
This means that the file can be created in a different
03:50
place and then moved or copied to a new location.
03:54
Last written refers to the last time
03:56
a file was saved for any reason.
03:58
It could prove that the file was copied from a
04:00
different location or that the file was altered.
04:03
Last access is any time a file is touched.
04:06
When combined with file creation metadata on a
04:09
user's machine, it can establish the probability that
04:12
the file was copied from one machine to another.
04:14
It also introduces the idea that a third
04:17
device is involved in data copy process.
04:20
Once the third device is found, it
04:22
makes obtaining answers much easier.
7. Netflow/sFlow
04:25
Network admins are always looking for a way to
04:28
look at what's happening inside their network.
04:31
Netflow is a session sampling protocol.
04:33
This protocol works at Layers 2 through 4.
04:36
It can exam each data flow that comes through or
04:39
be set to sample sessions at certain intervals.
04:43
If you want to sample packets in a broader
04:45
layer range, then sFlow is your answer.
04:48
This protocol works on Layers 2 through 7.
04:50
Unlike Netflow, sFlow examines packets
04:54
and can only be used in sampling mode.
04:57
This is stateless packet sampling
04:59
that provides information efficiently.
8. Ipfix
05:01
IPFIX integrates data that normally goes to Syslog or SNMP
05:06
information directly in the IPFIX packet, eliminating thee
05:11
additional services collecting data from each network device.
05:14
IPFIX has provisions for fields that are
05:17
variable-length, meaning no ID number restrictions.
05:21
It came about because of the need for a
05:23
standardized protocol for internal protocol flows.
05:26
This data comes from routers, servers, and other
05:29
network appliances that are mediation systems.
05:32
The data is formatted and sent to an
05:35
exporter and then on to a collector.
05:37
IPFIX, like NetFlow, looks at flow and the number of
05:41
packets being sent and received during a given session.
9. Summary
05:44
That's it for this lesson.
05:46
In this lesson, we talked about the
05:48
different ways metadata is produced.
05:50
We covered some of the pitfalls of metadata
05:52
as well as some of the ways to overcome them.
05:55
And we discussed creating a baseline
05:57
using network bandwidth monitors.
06:00
These monitors can alert us to
06:01
abnormal activity on our network.
