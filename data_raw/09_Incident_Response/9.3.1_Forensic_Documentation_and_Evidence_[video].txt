1. Forensic Documentation and Evidence
00:04
Digital forensic analysis is the art of revealing
00:08
important information from computer systems and networks.
00:11
Every piece of evidence can hold key information.
00:14
From deleted files to timestamps, user activity, and
00:17
unauthorized traffic, gathering and examining evidence from
00:21
computer systems and networks can reveal critical insights.
00:25
But how do we ensure the validity
00:26
and integrity of this evidence?<br>
2. Documentation
00:29
Documentation plays a crucial role in collecting,
00:31
preserving, and presenting valid digital proofs.
00:34
Failure to maintain a thorough record can
00:37
jeopardize the integrity of the evidence.
00:40
It's important to understand that there are various
00:42
processes and tools used to acquire different types
00:45
of digital evidence from computer hosts and networks.
00:49
By following strict protocols, these processes not
00:52
only demonstrate how evidence is acquired but also
00:55
establish that it's an accurate representation of
00:57
the system at the time of the event.<br>
01:00
Just like DNA or fingerprints, digital evidence is
01:03
latent, meaning it can't be seen with the naked eye.
01:06
It requires specialized machines and processes to interpret.
01:11
Therefore, formal steps must be taken to ensure
01:13
the admissibility of this evidence in court.
01:16
Proper documentation is crucial in showing how the evidence
01:20
was collected and analyzed without any tampering or bias.<br>
3. Due Process
01:24
This is where due process comes into play.
01:27
Just as the law requires fairness in criminal
01:29
convictions, forensic investigations must adhere
01:32
to procedural safeguards to ensure fairness.
01:35
Anyone involved in the investigation, from technicians
01:38
to managers, must be aware of these processes to avoid
01:41
compromising the integrity of the investigation.
01:44
Defense lawyers will always look for any doubts
01:47
or mistakes in the evidence or collection process.<br>
4. Legal Hold
01:50
When information becomes central to a
01:52
court case, it's essential to preserve it.
01:55
This concept, known as legal hold, entails suspending
01:58
routine deletion of electronic or paper records and logs.
02:02
Regulatory requirements, industry standards,
02:04
or litigation notices from law enforcement or
02:07
lawyers can trigger legal holds, leading to
02:10
the seizure of computer systems as evidence.
02:13
When information is subject to legal hold, computer
02:15
systems may be taken as evidence, disrupting the network.<br>
5. Chain of Custody
02:19
To maintain the integrity of the evidence,
02:21
a chain of custody is established.
02:24
Host devices and media from the crime scene are carefully
02:27
labeled, bagged, and sealed using tamper-evident bags.
02:30
Anti-static shielding is used to
02:32
protect electronic media from damage.
02:35
Each piece of evidence is documented on a chain
02:37
of custody form, recording who collected it, who
02:40
handled it afterward, what measures were taken
02:42
for backup and analysis, and where it was stored.
02:46
This ensures the evidence remains
02:47
intact and untampered with.
02:49
Finally, the collected evidence
02:51
is stored in a secure facility.
02:53
This not only includes access control but also environmental
02:56
control to protect the electronic systems from damage.<br>
03:00
By following these key elements—proper
03:02
documentation, due process, legal hold, and chain of
03:05
custody—digital forensic analysts can ensure the
03:08
validity and credibility of the evidence they gather.<br>
6. Summary
03:11
That's it for this lesson.
03:13
In this lesson, we talked about
03:14
forensic documentation and evidence.
03:17
We reviewed the importance of documentation and due process.
03:21
We discussed legal holds and the importance of the
03:23
chain of custody for ensuring the integrity of evidence.<br>
