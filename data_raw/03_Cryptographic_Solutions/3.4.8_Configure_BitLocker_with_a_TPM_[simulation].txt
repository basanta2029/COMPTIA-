Configure BitLocker with a TPM

You work as the IT security administrator for a small corporate network. The employee in Office 1 is working on a very sensitive project. Management is concerned that if the hard drive in the computer were stolen, sensitive information could be compromised. As a result, you have been asked to encrypt the entire System volume. The Office 1 computer has a built-in TPM on the motherboard.

In this lab, your task is to configure BitLocker drive encryption as follows:

From within the computer's BIOS, turn on and activate TPM Security.
From Windows, turn on BitLocker for the System (C:) drive.
Back up the recovery key to the \\CorpServer\BU-Office1 folder.
Encrypt the entire System (C:) drive.
Use the new encryption mode.
Run a BitLocker system check.
