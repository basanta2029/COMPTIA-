1. Secure Accounts on an iPad
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll show you techniques to secure
00:07
accounts on an iPad, specifically email and web browsing.
00:10
The web browser and email client on a mobile device,
00:13
as with any computer, represent one of the most serious
00:16
and most easily attacked vectors into the device.
00:19
Just as you need to secure the web browser
00:21
and email client on a Windows workstation, you
00:24
need to secure them on mobile devices as well.
00:26
Let's take a look at some things you can do.
00:29
We're currently using an iPad to do this demonstration.
00:32
For email, one of the key things we can do is
00:35
use SSL to communicate with the mail server.
00:37
This includes POP or IMAP servers,
00:40
as well as the SMTP server.
00:42
Let's look at how we do that.
2. Change Settings
00:44
Let's go into Settings.
00:45
We'll scroll up to Passwords & Accounts
00:48
Then we'll go into this Gmail account.
00:50
To do that, we tap on the email address
00:52
to get into the Account settings.
00:55
At the bottom, there's an Advanced selection.
00:57
Tap on Advanced.
00:59
You can see that we are using SSL to encrypt
01:01
communications between the mail client on
01:03
this mobile device and the mail server.
01:06
For this to work, the mail server for POP, IMAP,
01:08
and SMTP, must be configured to support SSL.
01:13
If it isn't, then turning this on won't accomplish anything.
01:16
Remember that POP3, IMAP, and SMTP
01:19
transmit clear text by default.
01:22
So, using SSL greatly increases the
01:24
security of your email communications.
01:26
If you're using a mobile device to send email messages
01:29
to someone through your mail server and you're not
01:31
using SSL, then any sensitive proprietary information
01:34
in that email is being transferred in clear text.
01:37
It could be sniffed and read by almost anyone.
01:40
Using SSL sets up an SSL tunnel between
01:42
the email client and the mail server.
01:44
The SSL tunnel secures message
01:46
transmission through that tunnel.
01:48
It is already enabled here.
3. Secure Safari
01:50
In addition to securing your email account, you also
01:53
need to secure the web browser on a mobile device.
01:55
Because we're using an iPad, Safari is the browser.
01:58
Let's get out of the account and go to Safari Settings.
02:02
We can do several things to increase
02:04
the overall security of the web browser.
02:06
First, let's look at autofill.
02:08
Notice that Use Contact Info is on.
02:10
To increase security, we'll turn that off.
02:13
In addition, Credit Cards is also on.
02:15
We'll also turn that off.
02:17
This option automatically fills out credit card information.
02:20
We don't want to do that; so let's keep that off.
02:23
Now we'll have to manually fill in contact and
02:25
credit card information in various web forms.
02:28
Autofill is a security challenge
02:30
on a workstation in an office.
02:32
It's a bigger problem on a mobile device.
02:34
Let's look at one more thing.
02:36
We'll go back up and tap Passwords & Accounts, on the
02:39
right we might want to turn off AutoFill Passwords.
02:42
That way if we lose this device, someone can't access
02:45
sites by having the passwords automatically populated.
02:48
We're done with this.
02:49
Let's go back and go to the main Safari settings.
02:52
Now we want to look at cookies.
02:54
Scroll down.
02:55
As you can see here under Privacy and Security,
02:57
we have Cookies, and the Block All Cookies option.
02:59
That's currently, that's turned off.
03:01
That means that it will not block cookies.
03:03
Let's turn that on.
03:04
When we turn it on, we are asked, "Hey, are you
03:07
sure you want to block all cookies?" Because if
03:09
we do, some websites are not going to work and
03:11
the existing cookies will be removed.
03:13
Let's tap Block All Cookies, and say goodbye to them.
03:15
Let's go back.
03:16
Now we need to enable Fraudulent Website Warning.
03:19
This is right below our Block All Cookies.
03:21
This will warn us if we're visiting a site the
03:23
browser thinks is a potentially fraudulent website.
03:27
Right now, you can see it's turned off.
03:28
Let's turn that on.
03:29
If we scroll down and tap Advanced, we
03:33
can see that JavaScript is currently on.
03:36
This is one of those issues where you have to balance
03:38
functionality and security, just like with the cookies.
03:41
Having JavaScript enabled makes the browser on this device
03:44
more functional, but it also opens up security issues.
03:47
The general advice is to disable JavaScript.
03:49
There will be sites that don't function properly,
03:52
however, because it's commonly used in a lot of websites,
03:55
but it does increase the security of the device.
03:58
We can turn it off if we want to,
03:59
so let's select to turn that off.
04:01
The last thing we're going to do to secure Safari
04:04
is to make sure that we're blocking pop-ups.
04:06
When we look here, we can see
04:08
Block pop-ups is not currently on.
04:10
Let's go ahead and turn that on.
04:12
That'll stop many of those annoying pop-up
04:14
windows that are so common on the internet.
04:16
It will help get rid of any of the annoying ads.
04:19
Also, we want to prevent drive by downloads from occurring.
04:22
At this point, the Safari web browser
04:24
is much more secure than it was.
4. Summary
04:27
In this demo, we talked about things you can do to
04:29
secure email and the web browser on a mobile device.
04:32
In this case, an iPad.
04:33
We configured the POP3 or IMAP and SMTP
04:36
protocols to secure communications between
04:39
the web client and the web server using SSL.
04:41
Then, we looked at what you can do to
04:44
secure the Safari web browser on an iPad.
04:47
We disabled autofill, we restricted cookies, we
04:50
turned fraud warning on, and we turned JavaScript off.
04:53
Then, we finished by turning on the pop-up blocker.
