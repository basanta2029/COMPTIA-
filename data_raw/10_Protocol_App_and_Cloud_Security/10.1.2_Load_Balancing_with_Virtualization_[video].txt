1. Load Balancing with Virtualization
00:04
Virtualization provides many advantages above simply
00:08
installing an operating system on a physical computer system.
00:12
One powerful benefit and feature is load balancing.
00:16
Let's look at how load balancing
00:17
works with virtual machines, or VMs.<br>
2. Clustering and Load Balancing
00:20
VMs run on top of a hypervisor which is
00:25
installed on physical hardware called a host.
00:28
The hypervisor decouples the
00:30
hardware from the VMs, or workloads.<br>
00:33
If we have two or more hosts, we can create a cluster.
00:37
Clusters usually require shared storage like a SAN where the
00:42
actual VM files reside and can be managed as a single entity.
00:47
While workloads are running in memory, they still
00:51
use real resources – real physical memory, real
00:54
storage, and really CPUs, and the cluster manages
00:58
that linking in an effective, optimized way.<br>
3. Aggregate Cluster Power
01:02
For example, if the cluster contains eight host servers
01:06
with four quad-core CPUs each running at 4GHz and 64GB
01:12
of memory, the cluster has an aggregate of 512GHz of CPU
01:17
power and 512GB of memory available for running VMs.
01:24
Having a cluster provides a number of benefits, including
01:27
high-availability, load balancing, and high performance.
01:32
Let's look at load balancing.<br>
4. Cluster Load Balancing
01:34
A cluster can sense which hosts are busy
01:37
and offload workloads to a less busy host.
01:40
It does this by monitoring hardware resources like
01:44
CPU and RAM on each host of the cluster to
01:48
determine the best placement for all the workloads.
01:51
The load is evaluated frequently, and workloads can
01:55
be adjusted dynamically to reallocate when needed.<br>
01:59
This means a VM or workload could move from one
02:03
host to another in a cluster for better performance.
02:07
And what's cool is this is seamless to the user—they
02:10
don't even notice all this is happening on the back end.<br>
02:14
This dynamic allocation load balances the
02:17
workloads across hosts in the cluster based
02:20
on host resource load and availability.
02:24
When a host gets busy, workloads will
02:27
be moved to another host on the fly.
02:30
That's powerful, and ensures each workload
02:33
gets the very best performance possible.<br>
02:36
Not all your hosts will have the same
02:38
hardware with CPU and RAM resources.
02:41
Some hosts will be beefier than others.
02:44
Some will have newer processors.
02:47
This means that some hosts can handle
02:49
more dense workloads than others.
02:51
The cluster can sense how busy each host is and adjust,
02:56
or load-balance, the workloads for best performance and to
02:59
best utilize CPU and memory resources across the cluster.<br>
5. Resource Pooling
03:05
Within a cluster, we can usually
03:06
create what's called a resource pool.
03:10
This helps us allocate CPU and RAM
03:12
resources to prioritize our workloads.<br>
03:15
Some workloads may have applications that are
03:18
mission critical and require specific resources
03:21
to always be up and running properly.
03:25
Other workloads may not be as important,
03:28
but still need adequate resources.
03:30
Resource pooling allows us to establish performance
03:33
boundaries within the cluster, so resources aren't
03:36
consumed by low-level workloads and keep important
03:40
workloads from starving for resources.<br>
03:43
So, a resource pool works within the cluster,
03:46
and may span two or more host servers.
03:49
Let's create Resource Pool A with a
03:52
certain amount of RAM and CPU shares.
03:55
After creating the pool, we can then
03:57
assign or create VMs to run in the pool.
04:01
We can create as many pools as we like in our cluster,
04:06
but we must always assign them CPU and memory performance.
04:10
Here's another pool – Resource Pool B.
04:14
We'll assign it a certain amount of CPU
04:17
and RAM, and then we'll assign VMs to it.<br>
04:21
In essence, the workloads end up being
04:23
load balanced, and they are throttled to
04:26
only use the established resource limits.
04:29
This allows admins to aggregate computing
04:32
capacity and delegate it for use rather
04:35
than focus on individual host servers.
04:38
And, as a bonus, if one host server goes
04:41
down, the other servers in the cluster will
04:43
pick up the workloads and continue on.<br>
04:47
You can create a resource pool on an individual host.
04:51
However, if you have a cluster, resource pooling will
04:54
provide more resources across the hosts in a cluster,
04:58
allowing you to better manage the use of those hardware
05:01
resources, including reservations for CPU and RAM usage.
05:06
The VMs will be load balanced within
05:09
the resource pool within the cluster.
05:12
This provides for rapid elasticity which leverages
05:15
virtualized server and storage technologies to rapidly
05:20
meet the rise and fall of user load and service demand.<br>
05:24
Hypervisor software that supports resource
05:27
pooling is downloadable from the internet.
05:30
You can download an evaluation copy to set up and
05:33
experiment with load balancing on virtual machines.<br>
6. Summary
05:38
That's it for this lesson.
05:40
Within the context of virtualization,
05:43
that's how load balancing works.
05:45
Clustering allows VMs to be load balanced
05:48
and highly available while providing the
05:51
best performance possible for each workload.
05:54
And resource pooling allows us to aggregate
05:56
hardware resources across multiple hosts ensuring
06:01
that the workloads get the resources they need
06:03
without sacrificing the performance of others.<br>
