1. Securing an Email Server
00:03
In this demonstration, we'll discuss how to prevent
00:06
spam from being relayed off your email servers.
00:08
To do this, we've installed an SMTP email
00:11
service on this Windows Server 2022 system.
00:15
Let's go to Tools.<br>
00:17
We're going to go to the IIS 6.0 Manager.
00:24
Expand that.
00:26
We managed this service using the IIS Manager 6.0.
00:31
Most email servers currently available will have similar
00:34
SMTP capabilities and provide the same SMTP options.<br>
00:39
Firstly, we can right-click on our SMTP server.
00:43
Go to Properties.
00:45
From here, we can lock down this email server.
00:48
We're going to go to the Access tab.
00:53
On the Access tab, you can require
00:56
authentication to access this server.
00:59
The default is Anonymous access, meaning
01:01
anybody can connect without authenticating.
01:04
You should disable this option and
01:06
require at least Basic authentication.<br>
01:09
If you have Anonymous authentication enabled and allow
01:12
open relay, spammers will quickly find this system and
01:16
start bouncing spam off your server to cover their tracks.
01:20
If this happens, you're the one who gets in
01:22
trouble, and your ISP may block your email server.<br>
01:26
You can also use Integrated Windows
01:28
Authentication, which would require you to
01:30
use the domain credentials to authenticate.
01:32
Basic authentication requires users just to enter a
01:35
password but be aware that basic authentication is sent
01:38
clear text by default, which would expose the password.<br>
2. Securing Authentication
01:41
Alternatively, you can combine it with TLS encryption,
01:45
the next generation of SSL, to secure authentication
01:48
credentials as they're transmitted on the network.
01:51
You can also require a secure connection to
01:52
connect to this SMTP server in the first place.<br>
01:56
This option requires an SSL or TLS certificate
01:59
for this server to secure the connection.
02:02
You can also use Connection control to
02:04
configure who's allowed to connect to this SMTP
02:06
server and who is blocked from connecting.
02:09
This can be done using your IP addresses.
02:12
You can use a range of IPs.<br>
02:15
You can also do this using domain names as well.
02:17
This requires reverse DNS lookups to be enabled.
02:20
Using this information, you can restrict
02:23
who is allowed access to the server.
02:25
You can also implement Relay restrictions, which specify
02:28
who is allowed to relay email through the SMTP server.
02:32
You can allow everyone except those specified on
02:35
the list or block everyone except those on the list.
02:39
As before, you can also specify an
02:41
IP or IP range or a domain name.<br>
3. Summary
02:44
That's it for this demonstration.
02:46
In this demonstration, we reviewed a few security
02:48
configurations you can implement to prevent email
02:51
from being relayed off of your SMTP server.<br>
