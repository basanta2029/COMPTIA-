1. Protecting a Client from Spam
00:04
In this demo, we're going to talk
00:06
about protecting a client from spam.
00:07
We're going to look at spam settings in two email services.
00:10
One is Gmail, and we're going to
00:12
access it through a web browser.
00:14
The other is the Outlook web mail client.
2. Gmail
00:17
Let's start with Gmail.
00:18
I already have my browser open, and I've logged into Gmail.
00:20
It has a few functions that are set up automatically to help
00:23
you organize and sort out types of email, especially spam.
00:27
When I come down here and select this email,
00:29
I get some options, including Report Spam.
00:32
If I select that, it'll be moved to my Spam folder, and
00:35
all emails coming from this address will be marked as spam.
00:38
I'll undo that for this email.
00:41
Another thing I can do is right-click
00:42
and look at some more options.
00:44
A better choice for this email might be
00:45
to label it Promotions rather than Spam.
00:48
Now let's click on the Promotions
00:49
tab and see what's in there.
00:51
I see several emails, many already sorted for me.
00:54
If I right-click again, I can see, under
00:56
Label As, that it's labeled Promotions.
00:59
Let's look at the contents of our Spam Folder.
01:02
If I click on it, we can see several emails in there.
01:05
If you find some emails in here that aren't spam,
01:07
you can select them and then click Not Spam.
01:10
All emails in this folder are
01:11
deleted 30 days after they arrive.
01:14
Now let's look at the settings.
01:15
Here, you'll find Filters and Blocked Addresses.
01:18
Down here, you'll find the email
01:19
addresses you've previously blocked.
01:22
These emails are marked as spam.
01:24
If, for some reason you need to
01:25
change that, this is where you do it.
3. Outlook
01:27
Now let's look at another web-based email client, Outlook.
01:31
I'm already in Outlook, and here's my inbox.
01:33
I have one email down here.
01:35
Let's select it.
01:36
I have a tab up here called Junk.
01:38
When I click on it, I get a dropdown, and I
01:40
have a few choices: Junk, Phishing, and Block.
01:43
Let's click each of these for more information.
01:46
First, I'll click on Junk.
01:47
This will add this email to the list of Spam mail senders.
01:50
I can change my mind and click Undo.
01:54
Next, click on Phishing.
01:56
When we do that, this email is reported as a Phishing email
01:59
to Microsoft so they can better detect these on their end.
02:02
This isn't a Phishing email, so
02:03
I'll click the Don't Report button.
02:05
The third option is Block.
02:07
This won't report the email, but maybe
02:09
it's just one that I don't care to receive
02:11
any longer, and unsubscribing doesn't help.
02:13
Once again, I'll cancel and not really block the email.
02:16
Let's take a look at the Junk Email folder.
02:19
I have two emails in here that aren't junk, so I'll
02:21
tell Outlook that, and they'll go back to my inbox.
02:24
I'll do that for both emails.
02:26
Now, if I look at my inbox, both emails are there.
02:29
Let's look at our settings in Outlook.
02:35
I'll click on the Junk Email option here.
02:37
Let's look at our options.
02:39
We can block senders or entire
02:40
domains from sending you email.
02:42
I click on Add, and I can put in an email
02:45
address or a domain that I want to block.
02:47
Or maybe a sender is getting
02:48
labeled as spam, but it isn't spam.
02:51
If that's the case, I can add those emails and
02:53
domains here, under the Safe senders and domains list.
02:56
The last one here is Safe mailing lists.
02:58
For example, I'm a member of several mail lists related
03:01
to tech, and many spam filters mark them as spam.
03:04
I can enter them here to make sure that doesn't happen.
03:07
At the bottom of the page, we have a couple of filters.
03:10
The first one is to only trust emails
03:11
from my Safe senders and domains list.
03:14
This would be pretty restrictive and take a lot of updating.
03:17
But if you only want to use this email to communicate
03:19
with coworkers or family members, this might be a
03:21
great thing, especially for children or the elderly.
03:25
The next one will block attachments from anyone
03:27
not in your Safe senders and domains list.
03:29
This isn't as restrictive, and it's probably a good
03:32
way to prevent malware from coming to your mailbox.
03:35
Be aware that these are just client settings, and on the
03:37
server side of things, you probably have even more settings.
03:40
In addition, ISPs and mail hosts are filtering
03:43
emails before they even arrive to your client.
03:45
In general, processes for catching spam have come a
03:48
long way, but you still have to do some things manually.
4. Summary
03:51
That's it for this demo.
03:52
In this demo, we configured spam
03:54
filtering in Gmail and Outlook.
