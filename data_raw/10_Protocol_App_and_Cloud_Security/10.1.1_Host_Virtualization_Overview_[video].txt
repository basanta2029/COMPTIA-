1. Host Virtualization Overview
00:04
Let's spend a few minutes talking about
00:05
virtualization and virtual network components.
00:06
Virtualization is a very important
00:10
aspect of modern computing.
00:13
But before we talk about what virtualization
00:15
is and how it works, we first need to look at
00:18
the way things have traditionally been done.
2. Traditional Computing Model
00:20
In the traditional computing model, we have one operating
00:23
system, or OS, installed on one hardware device.
00:28
In this example, we have hardware that consists
00:30
of our CPU, storage, and memory resources.
00:34
We need an operating system to run these resources,
00:36
which could be Windows, Linux, or even macOS.
00:40
Either way, we have one hardware device
00:42
being managed by one operating system.
00:45
The operating system's role is to provide
00:47
services for all the applications that run on
00:50
the hardware device so that they can utilize the
00:52
memory, storage, and CPU resources efficiently.
00:56
Here we have App1, App2, App3, and App4.
01:00
Each app makes its own requests for hardware
01:03
resources, and then the OS makes that happen.
01:07
For example, let's suppose you're going to
01:08
install a new server in your data center.
01:11
The first thing you'd do is order your server
01:13
hardware and then you'd pick an operating system.
01:16
When the server comes, you'd install a
01:19
server operating system on the hardware.
01:21
The operating system has full reign over all the resources
01:24
available on the server hardware, including RAM, processor
01:28
time, storage devices, network interfaces, and so on.
01:33
Finally, you'd install applications on top of that
01:35
operating system that would interact with system resources.
3. Problems with Traditional Computing Model
01:39
There's a fundamental problem with doing
01:41
things this way—it's terribly inefficient.
01:44
Usually, applications that run on the OS don't fully
01:47
utilize all the hardware resources all the time.
01:50
This is often true on a server system, and you
01:53
find out that a lot of times your computing
01:55
resources are actually underutilized.
01:58
For example, you may see your CPU utilization
02:00
hovering around 10% most of the time.
02:03
You may also see that your memory utilization
02:06
is likewise hovering at around 20%.
02:08
This means 80-90% capacity is still available
02:12
to perform additional computing tasks.
02:15
Servers are expensive, and wasted
02:16
capacity means wasted dollars.
02:19
Many times, servers are purchased for a specific
02:21
purpose such as running web servers for individual apps.
02:25
This can lead to server sprawl for the many
02:27
underutilized servers This sucks up lots of power, puts
02:30
out tons of heat, and costs an immense amount of money.
02:34
But there's a way to overcome this and consolidate
02:36
all those servers into just a few, compact ones.
02:40
That's where virtualization comes in.
4. Virtualization Roles
02:40
Virtualization enables you to run multiple
02:45
servers on a single physical server, called
02:47
a host, through hardware virtualization.
02:50
When you do this, each independent operating system or
02:54
virtual machine thinks it has all the hardware resources
02:57
it needs and runs in its own little isolated container.
03:01
So instead of the many underutilized servers in
03:04
traditional networking, with virtualization we can
03:07
put many servers together on one hardware chassis to
03:10
fully utilize CPU, RAM, disk, and network subsystems.
03:15
Virtualization increases IT agility, allows for greater
03:18
flexibility, delivers increased performance, and allows you
03:22
to scale up quickly while enjoying significant cost savings.
03:26
We'll get to some more important benefits in just a minute.
03:29
Nowadays, we can virtualize just about anything—operating
03:33
systems, storage, apps, networking, desktops, and more.
03:38
Virtualization can also be enabled in the cloud where
03:41
much of the computing can be done remotely without you
03:44
having to build and maintain your own data center.
03:46
It also allows companies to build their own private
03:49
clouds in their data centers to virtually deliver
03:51
their homemade apps to their corporate users.
03:54
Now users can use just about any device to securely access
03:58
their workloads remotely at any place, anytime, anywhere.
04:01
The power of virtualization is driving an immense,
04:05
global, and increasingly mobile workforce.
5. Hypervisors
04:07
Virtualization starts with you installing a thin piece of
04:10
software called a hypervisor, which decouples the virtual
04:14
machines, or VMs, from the hardware and dynamically
04:18
allocates resources as the virtual machines request them.
04:22
Once the hypervisor is installed, you can then create
04:24
virtual machines with their own operating system and apps.
04:29
Notice in this diagram we have our
04:30
memory, storage, and CPU just like before.
04:34
But instead of installing an operating system directly
04:36
onto the host, we install a hypervisor to manage it.
04:40
On top of the hypervisor, we create virtual
04:42
machines by allocating CPU, RAM, and storage.
04:46
Generally, the more hardware you have on the
04:48
host, the more virtual machines you can build.
04:51
These physical servers that host multiple virtual
04:54
machines have lots of processors and lots of RAM, and
04:57
they're usually connected to an immense storage area
05:00
network, or SAN, that's made to be fault tolerant.
05:05
Notice that each VM has its own OS and
05:07
applications in an isolated container.
05:10
Each VM makes calls to use each piece of hardware,
05:13
and the hypervisor facilitates those requests.
05:17
You can install just about any OS inside of
05:19
a VM and then run apps built for that OS.
6. Hardware Virtualization Types
05:23
Before we go on, there are three kinds of hardware
05:25
virtualization that you need to be familiar with.
7. Full Virtualization
05:28
The first type is called full virtualization.
05:30
In full virtualization, the virtual machine
05:34
completely emulates a real, physical host.
05:37
This is good because it allows most operating
05:39
systems and applications to run within that
05:42
virtual machine without being modified in any way.
05:45
The hypervisor fully decouples the
05:48
operating system from the hardware.
05:50
There are two types of full virtualization: bare-metal
05:52
hypervisors (type 1) and hosted hypervisors (type 2).
05:52
We'll learn more about these in just a minute.
8. Partial Virtualization
06:00
Another form of virtualization
06:02
is called partial virtualization.
06:03
In partial virtualization, some virtual machine
06:07
components are virtualized while others aren't.
06:10
In other words, the OS uses some virtual components
06:13
and some physical components while it runs.
06:16
It's important to note that an operating system can only
06:19
run in a partial virtualization environment if that
06:22
operating system has been specifically modified to do so.
9. Paravirtualization
06:26
The last type of virtualization
06:28
is called paravirtualization.
06:29
In paravirtualization, the
06:32
hardware isn't virtualized at all.
06:34
In other words, all the guest operating systems
06:37
running on the hypervisor actually access various
06:40
hardware resources in the physical devices directly.
06:43
It doesn't virtualize any of the components.
06:46
To do this, the guest operating systems run in
06:48
isolated domains on the same physical hardware, which
06:52
basically simulates running on separate systems.
06:55
For an operating system to run on a paravirtualization
06:58
environment, it must be specially modified to do so.
07:02
As you can see, a hypervisor is a fundamental
07:05
component in any virtualization implementation.
10. Hypervisor Types
07:08
There are several different hypervisors that
07:11
you can choose from, and they generally fall
07:13
within two main categories: type 1 and type 2.
11. Type 1 Hypervisors
07:17
As we mentioned, type 1 hypervisors are installed
07:19
directly onto the hardware and allow you to build VMs.
07:23
This type is used in data centers to virtualize servers.
07:27
Examples of type 1 hypervisors include
07:29
VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, Linux
07:34
KVM, Citrix Hypervisor, Xen, and Oracle VM.
07:39
These are enterprise-class hypervisors for serious,
07:42
large-scale virtualization deployments that provide an
07:45
array of management tools and feature-rich benefits.
12. Type 2 Hypervisors
07:48
Alternatively, we have type 2 hypervisors.
07:51
Since type 2 hypervisors are hosted and run on
07:54
top of a regular operating system, they allow
07:56
you to get a test environment up and running
07:59
quickly without having to buy huge systems.
08:02
Examples of type 2 hypervisors are VMware
08:05
Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft
08:08
Hyper-V which is built into Windows 8.1 and 10.
08:13
All these hypervisors perform basically
08:14
the same role that we talked about before.
08:17
They allow you to install multiple operating
08:19
systems on a single physical server.
13. Virtualization Benefits
08:22
There are many benefits to implementing
08:24
virtualization in your environment.
08:26
The biggest drivers are reduced expenses
08:28
and increased return on investment.
08:30
Most virtualization platforms provide redundancy
08:33
and load balancing, which minimize downtime.
08:36
Also, unlike traditional computing where you have
08:38
to go out and buy a physical server, you can spin
08:41
up a virtual server in a fraction of the time.
08:44
You can also take server snapshots in
08:46
case you need to make a server rollback.
08:49
An entire VM is stored in just a few files, and they
08:52
can easily be copied or moved as you would any file.
08:56
Finally, virtualization makes IT tasks
08:58
much easier to manage and less costly.
09:01
With benefits like these, you can see why
09:03
nearly all companies are using some form
09:06
of virtualization in their business today.
14. Virtual Machine Escape
09:08
Before we finish, we need to discuss
09:10
a possible virtualization attack.
09:12
Virtual machine escape is one of the security threats an
09:15
attacker can take advantage of from within a virtual machine.
09:19
Typically after escaping
09:21
out of a guest virtual machine, an exploiter can execute
09:24
code on the hypervisor or the host operating system.
09:27
The threat actor can gain access to the primary hypervisor
09:31
and perform administrative tasks like VM deletion, powering
09:35
off, resource allocation, and much more.
09:39
The best way to prevent virtual machine
09:41
escape is to regularly patch your hypervisor.
09:43
Keeping your hypervisor current goes
09:46
a long way in preventing exploits.
15. Summary
09:49
That's it for this lesson.
09:50
In this lesson, you were introduced to
09:52
virtualization's common roles and functions.
09:54
We discussed how virtualization works,
09:56
different virtualization types, the hypervisors
09:59
you can use, and virtualization benefits.
10:02
We ended this lesson by discussing virtual machine
10:04
escape and how you can prevent these attacks.
