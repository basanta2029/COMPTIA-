1. Software-Defined Networking Basics
00:04
Even though software-defined networking, also know
00:07
as SDN, is a relatively new approach to networking,
00:09
its use has grown exponentially the last few years.<br>
00:13
The idea behind SDN is that network engineers should be
00:15
able to use software to configure and intelligently control
00:18
the network, rather than relying on the individual static
00:21
configuration files that are located on each network device.
00:26
By using SDN, network engineers are given the ability and
00:29
flexibility to control their networks programmatically in
00:32
order to accommodate rapidly changing environments.<br>
2. SDN Controller
00:35
For example, let's say you work in a datacenter.
00:37
In this datacenter, you need a lot of equipment
00:39
to create a network servers, switches, bridges,
00:43
load balancers, cables, et cetera.<br>
00:45
All of these devices are highly capable of making truly
00:48
intelligent decisions within their individual capabilities.
00:52
However, they require individual
00:54
configurations on each of the devices.
00:56
And if you need to make a change that affects
00:58
multiple devices, then you need to manually
01:01
make that change on each of these devices.
01:04
In addition, making all of these devices work
01:06
together perfectly can be a bit of a headache.
01:09
For example, devices from different vendors
01:11
might not work properly with each other.<br>
01:14
With SDN, however, the configuration,
01:16
management, and communication of all these
01:19
devices is standardized and centralized.
01:23
Software-defined networking takes all of these
01:25
devices and combines them in much the same way a
01:27
computer combines internal hardware components.
01:30
It does this by using what's called a
01:32
software-defined network controller.<br>
01:35
An SDN controller functions a lot like
01:37
traditional desktop operating system.
01:40
It is able to inventory hardware components in the
01:42
network, gather network statistics, make routing
01:45
decisions based on gathered data, and facilitate
01:48
communication between devices from different vendors.
01:52
It can also be used to make wide-spread
01:54
configuration changes on just one device.
01:57
In essence, it's sort of like an
01:58
operating system for the network.<br>
3. Communication
02:00
For example, take our datacenter here.
02:02
Let's say this datacenter suddenly gets an
02:05
influx of user connections, and it needs to spin
02:07
up new virtual machines to handle the load.
02:10
Or perhaps it needs to offload some of
02:12
these connections to another datacenter.<br>
02:14
In a traditional networking environment, spinning up new
02:17
VMs, routing connections to these VMs, and propagating
02:21
these changes throughout the network could take too much
02:24
time, and users wouldn't be able to use their resources.<br>
02:27
With SDN, however, this influx of
02:29
users is identified by the controller.
02:31
The network administrator can then make configuration
02:34
changes on the controller to redirect users to the new VMs.
02:38
And because all these configurations are controlled at
02:41
a central location the controller they are propagated
02:44
out to the network almost instantaneously, allowing the
02:47
users to have no interruption in their connections.
02:50
When the influx of user connections returns
02:53
to normal, the controller can then return
02:55
the network to the state it was in before.<br>
02:57
One of the primary advantages to using an SDN controller is
03:01
that it can also act autonomously in situations like this.
03:04
For example, if this scenario occurs again,
03:07
the controller can remember the actions that
03:09
were taken and perform them automatically.<br>
4. Summary
03:12
So, it's pretty easy to see why
03:14
software-defined networking is here to stay.<br>
03:16
That's it for this lesson.
03:18
In this lesson, we learned the basics of
03:20
software-defined networking, including how it works and
03:22
how the controller communicates with network devices and
03:25
responds to events like an influx of user connections.<br>
