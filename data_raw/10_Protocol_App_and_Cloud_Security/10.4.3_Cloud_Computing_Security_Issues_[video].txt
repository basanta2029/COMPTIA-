1. Cloud Computing Security Issues
00:04
Let's talk about cloud computing security issues.
00:07
The benefits offered by cloud computing—"the ability
00:09
to use applications, platforms, and infrastructure as
00:12
needed, and not use them when you don't—"is attractive.
00:15
However, security is a key issue.
2. Cloud Security Considerations
00:18
In a traditional system, you secure data behind
00:20
layer after layer of security
00:22
mechanisms—"firewalls, ACLs, encryption, et cetera.
00:26
And even after all that, it's still a
00:28
challenge to keep your network safe.
00:30
Add in the cloud component, and now all that data is being
00:33
sent across the internet to a third-party organization who
00:36
also needs to maintain their own system security.
00:40
Ultimately, the decision to utilize a cloud
00:42
provider comes down to a partnership of trust.
00:45
The cloud computing service provider has to ensure
00:48
the security and privacy of your information.
00:51
Security is part of the service they provide.
00:53
However, you, as a security administrator, are still
00:57
responsible for protecting your company's data.
01:00
One of the key things you need to remember is that
01:02
industry and government regulations created to protect
01:05
personal and business information still apply.
01:08
Even though the data is being stored by the cloud
01:11
computing provider, you're still responsible.
01:14
Whenever an organization is evaluating a move to the
01:16
cloud, I always tell them that they need to approach the
01:19
process of picking a cloud service provider in the same
01:22
way they would buying a used car from a dealership.
01:25
A used car may look great on the surface, but what you
01:28
really need to be concerned with is what's under the hood.
01:31
Take the same approach when
01:32
selecting a cloud service provider.
01:34
Let's go over some of the key security considerations you
01:37
need to keep in mind if you use a cloud service provider.
3. Trust the Provider
01:40
First, there's an issue of trust.
01:42
You have to trust that your cloud service
01:44
provider is good at information security.
01:47
If your provider hasn't done a good job securing
01:49
their environment, you could be in trouble.
01:52
You can insist that the cloud services
01:53
provider implement specific security
01:56
measures, but you can't physically make them.
4. Security Monitoring
01:59
In addition, there's a monitoring issue.
02:01
It's difficult to monitor security issues when your
02:04
environment is provided by a cloud service provider.
02:07
You're not on site, so you don't know
02:09
what security issues they're facing.
02:11
You don't see the midnight attack
02:12
that they had to fight off last night.
02:14
The cloud service provider probably doesn't
02:16
want to let you know about it because they're
02:18
afraid you might terminate their services.
02:21
Likewise, it's difficult to measure a cloud
02:23
provider's degree of competence with information
02:26
security because they probably don't want to
02:28
expose their infrastructure to customers.
02:31
Therefore, as we talked about with monitoring,
02:33
it's hard to know how things are really going
02:35
with your cloud computing environment.
02:37
All you see really is the user interface.
5. Authentication, Partitioning, and Updates
02:40
Another thing to consider is authentication.
02:43
Make sure that the cloud service provider
02:45
authenticates everyone who's going to use the service.
02:48
Don't choose the cloud service
02:49
provider if they allow free access.
02:52
The next key thing to look for is partitioning.
02:54
In other words, they make sure that your
02:56
information and your data is kept completely
02:59
separate from other customers' information and data.
03:02
You don't want a fellow cloud computing
03:04
customer gaining access to your data.
03:07
Within your organization, make sure that your individual
03:10
users only have access to the applications that they need.
03:14
Do not allow them to choose whatever they want to use.
03:17
One way to do this is to use a
03:19
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).
03:21
A CASB is a software tool or a service that sits
03:26
between an organization and a cloud service provider.
03:29
Its job is to make sure that all communication and
03:32
access to the cloud service provider complies with
03:35
the organization's security policies and procedures.
03:39
For example, it might make sure devices connecting to the
03:42
cloud meet certain security standards, such as full-device
03:45
encryption, up-to-date malware protection, et cetera.
03:49
The next key thing to look for is updating.
03:51
Make sure that the cloud service provider
03:53
maintains a rigorous patch management program
03:56
to ensure that the systems are updated.
03:59
This will help protect your
04:00
information from potential exploits.
6. Processes, Policies, and Procedures
04:03
After that, check out their processes.
04:05
A good cloud computing service provider
04:07
should have processes, policies, and
04:09
procedures in place to handle various events.
04:13
These processes, policies, and procedures should
04:15
include everything, from something as simple as
04:18
requesting access to a new application or something
04:20
as critical as dealing with a major security breach.
04:24
When you're evaluating a company, ask the company for
04:27
a copy of these policies and procedures so you can see
04:29
what they are going to do if a certain event happens.
04:33
In addition, verify that the cloud service provider has
04:36
policies and procedures in place for monitoring security
04:39
logs, monitoring unusual behavior, and performing the
04:42
various tasks required to keep their system safe.
7. Encryption and Probing
04:46
Next, make sure that they use some form of encryption to
04:49
ensure that the data passing between your organization
04:51
and their service is encrypted and can't be sniffed.
04:55
Most likely, the data will pass through the
04:57
untrusted network connection that is the internet.
05:00
Secure data transmission is critical.
05:03
Last, the cloud computing service provider
05:05
should probe their system on a regular basis.
05:08
They should contract with a third party
05:10
whose expertise is breaking into systems.
05:13
The third party should probe the cloud computing service
05:15
to see if there are any weaknesses that can be exploited.
8. Summary
05:19
Cloud services are here to stay.
05:21
No matter the organization you work for, they are
05:23
probably going to use some type of cloud service.
05:26
This is because cloud services are
05:28
very cost-effective and convenient.
05:30
However, with convenience comes risk.
05:32
And it's your job as a security professional
05:34
to identify those risk, account for them, and
05:37
minimize them as much as possible.
