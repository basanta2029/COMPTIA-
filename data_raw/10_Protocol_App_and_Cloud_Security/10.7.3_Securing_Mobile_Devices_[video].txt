1. Secure Mobile Devices
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going
00:05
to discuss mobile device security.
00:07
Specifically, we're going to look at a few things
00:10
you can do to increase the overall security of an
00:12
iPad running the iOS operating system.<br>
2. Passcode Locks
00:15
Let's begin with passcode locks.
00:18
I'm going to go to Settings, then to Touch ID &amp; Passcodes.<br>
00:21
Now, I need to enter my current passcode.<br>
00:24
You can use passcodes on your iPad to
00:26
protect the information stored on the device.
00:28
If you set a passcode, then every time you either
00:31
power on the device or wake it up, you will be
00:33
prompted to enter the passcode before you can run any
00:35
apps or access any of the information on the device.<br>
00:38
That's a really good idea in case you forget this
00:41
device in a taxicab, hotel, train station, or airport.
00:44
You don't want just anyone to pick up the
00:46
device and have full access to whatever's on it.<br>
00:48
So, let's look at how you do this.
00:50
Notice that, right now, passcodes are currently turned on.
00:54
Let's go ahead and tap Turn Passcode Off,
00:56
and then we're prompted to confirm that.
00:58
I'll tap Cancel.<br>
01:01
Right below that, I can change the passcode.
01:03
And when I tap it, the iPad wants to know what my current
01:06
passcode is before it allows me to change to a new one.<br>
01:09
So, that is how you work with passcodes.<br>
3. Auto Lock
01:11
In addition, we can also specify how long
01:13
this device can be idle before we're going
01:15
to require the passcode to be re-entered.
01:17
So, first, we need to go to Display &amp; Brightness.
01:20
And then to Auto-Lock right here.
01:22
Notice that currently, Auto-Lock is set to Never.
01:26
That means that this iPad can sit idle forever and the
01:29
user will not be required to re-enter the passcode.<br>
01:32
Let's change that.
01:34
I'm going to tap on Never.
01:35
And let's set the auto-lock for 15 minutes.
01:37
Now, if this iPad sits idle for 15 minutes,
01:41
meaning I'm not tapping anything, then the
01:43
screen is automatically going to lock.<br>
01:45
So, to this point, we've enabled a passcode, and we've
01:49
set our screen to automatically lock after 15 minutes.
01:51
So far, we've increased the security
01:53
a little bit on this device.<br>
4. Erase Data
01:55
But there are more things we can do.
01:57
I'll tap Touch ID &amp; Password again.
01:59
I'll enter in my passcode.<br>
02:01
Now scroll to the bottom of this screen.
02:03
There's an option called Erase Data.
02:05
If I turn Erase Data on, then all the data on
02:08
this iPad will be erased if the user tries to
02:11
enter an incorrect password 10 times in a row.
02:13
After 10 consecutive failed passcode attempts,
02:16
all the data on this iPad is going to get erased.<br>
02:20
Let's turn that option on.
02:21
And it warns us, "Hey, if you turn this option
02:24
on, then everything on this iPad is going to be
02:26
erased after 10 failed passcode attempts."
02:29
We're going to go ahead and say, "Nope."
02:31
I'm borrowing this iPad, so the owner might not like that.<br>
02:34
This is a powerful option, and you need to
02:36
carefully decide whether you want it on.
02:38
If you have it turned on and someone enters the wrong
02:40
passcode 10 times in a row, you'll have to restore all
02:43
the data on this iPad from backup, either from iTunes on
02:46
a PC using a USB cable or pulling it down from iCloud.<br>
02:50
Basically, what we're assuming is that if somebody enters
02:52
the wrong passcode 10 times in a row, it isn't their iPad.
02:56
So, at this point, we've really increased
02:59
the overall security of this device.<br>
5. Locate a Lost Device
03:01
Another aspect of mobile device security
03:04
involves being able to track down a lost device
03:06
because, well, mobile devices do get lost.
03:09
They get lost all the time.
03:11
People leave them on airplanes.
03:12
They get left in hotels, taxicabs,
03:14
elevators, and train stations.
03:21
If this happens, you not only want to protect
03:23
the data on the device, you also probably want
03:26
to figure out where that device is.<br>
03:28
Many mobile devices provide functionality
03:31
that you can use to locate the lost device.
03:33
The iOS operating system running on this
03:35
iPad provides a function called Find My iPad,
03:38
and it's tied to the iCloud backup function.
03:41
If we enable this function and then we lose this iPad,
03:44
we can sign into iCloud from any web browser on a PC or
03:48
a laptop system and then use the Find My iPad option to
03:51
view the device's approximate location on a map.<br>
03:54
I tapped iCloud a second ago.
03:56
Now scroll down a little bit.
03:58
Notice down here that the Find My
04:00
iPad option is already turned on.
04:02
This gives us a lot of options.<br>
04:05
For example, you could have a message displayed on the iPad
04:08
that tells whoever finds it how to get in touch with you.
04:10
You could even use iCloud.com to go in and remotely
04:14
change the passcode lock assigned to this device.
04:17
And if you're really concerned about not
04:19
losing the data on a lost device, then you
04:21
can use iCloud.com to perform a remote wipe.<br>
04:24
Essentially, what we're doing with a remote wipe is
04:27
assuming that the iPad is lost, that the person who
04:29
found it has no intention of returning it, and that they
04:32
may want to get at the information that's stored on it.
04:35
In this case, you can use iCloud.com to send a
04:38
remote wipe command to the iPad, which will then
04:40
restore the iPad to its original factory settings.
04:43
Any personal information on it, as well as any
04:46
proprietary sensitive information belonging to
04:48
your organization, gets wiped out.<br>
04:50
If you have this option turned on, it's
04:52
not a bad idea to come over here, under
04:54
Backup, and turn on iCloud Backup as well.
04:58
The idea here is that if you ever do end up performing
05:01
a remote wipe, or if you end up losing the iPad
05:03
altogether and never get it back, then you can restore
05:06
all the data from your old iPad onto a new iPad.
05:08
Go ahead and tap Cancel for now.<br>
6. Summary
05:10
That's it for this demonstration.
05:12
In this demo, we talked about some things
05:14
you can do to increase the overall security
05:16
of a mobile device, in this case, an iPad.
05:19
We began this demonstration by talking
05:21
about how to set passcode locks.
05:23
We talked about how to set the
05:24
auto-lock feature of the iPad.
05:26
We talked about wiping the data off the iPad if somebody
05:29
enters the wrong passcode more than 10 times in a row.
05:32
Then we ended this demonstration by
05:34
talking about how to locate a lost device
05:36
using the Find My iPad option and iCloud.<br>
