1. Virtual Network Devices
00:05
Let's talk a little bit about virtual networks.
00:08
A virtual network is a computer network
00:10
consisting of virtual and physical devices.
00:13
Virtual devices save organizations money.
00:16
By using less physical storage space, a company is able
00:19
to have at least twice as many devices in a network
00:22
because they pay for very little space in a data center.<br>
2. Protocol-Based Virtualization
00:26
One form of network virtualization is protocol-based.
00:30
You should already be familiar
00:31
with this type of virtualization.
00:32
VLANs and VPNs are two examples of
00:36
protocol-based network virtualization.<br>
00:39
Remember, with a VLAN, the network
00:41
devices aren't physically segmented.
00:43
The only thing that segments these devices
00:45
is software defining how communications are
00:48
routed by looking at the VLAN IDs of packets.
00:52
The same is true with a VPN.
00:54
There's no dedicated, physical connection
00:56
between two devices using a VPN.
00:58
It's a virtualized dedicated connection.<br>
01:02
Now, let's go over some virtual networking devices and how
01:05
they can be used to create a more secure network design.<br>
3. vSwitch
01:09
The first network device we'll look
01:11
at is a virtual switch, or vSwitch.
01:12
A vSwitch is a software application that facilitates
01:17
the communication between VMs by checking data
01:20
packets before moving them to a destination.
01:22
vSwitches are often integrated
01:25
with virtual machine software.
01:27
Sometimes, they're even part of a server's firmware.<br>
01:30
The nice thing about a vSwitch is it's much easier
01:33
to implement and manage than a traditional switch.
01:36
In addition, a vSwitch can actually ensure
01:38
the security integrity of virtual hosts,
01:41
thereby creating a more secure network.
01:44
For example, a vSwitch could make sure that a
01:46
VM meets certain security criteria before it is
01:49
allowed to communicate on the virtual network.
01:52
If it fails the security check,
01:54
its communications will be blocked.<br>
01:57
Some of the most common vSwitch platforms are Open vSwitch
02:00
(OVS), VMware virtual switch, and the Cisco Nexus 1000v.
02:05
All three can function within a software-defined
02:08
network as an SDN controller, allowing a much
02:12
more dynamic network environment.<br>
4. vRouter
02:14
A virtual router, or vRouter, is a software
02:17
function that replicates a physical router.<br>
02:20
The nice thing about a virtual router is that
02:22
it doesn't need to rely on the IP routing
02:25
functionality used by physical routers.
02:28
This means you can move routing functions around a network
02:31
freely, creating a more dynamic network environment.<br>
02:34
In addition, when you use a virtual router,
02:37
you are free from a specific vendor ecosystem.
02:40
This means you aren't locked in to
02:42
proprietary applications or protocols and can
02:45
more customize your networking environment.
02:48
Virtual routers even work well with SDN infrastructure.<br>
5. Drawbacks of Virtual Networking Devices
02:52
Note that, while virtual networking devices can be
02:56
very flexible and offer a lot of benefits, they still
02:59
aren't a replacement for physical networking devices.<br>
03:02
Virtual networking devices use shared hardware resources,
03:06
making them a poor choice for resource-intensive tasks,
03:07
such as encrypting and decrypting information.
03:12
Load balancing can also become an issue as the
03:15
resources used to route, switch, and load-balance
03:19
communication are shared among the devices.<br>
03:22
Another drawback is all of these components rely on software
03:26
applications and are susceptible to things like VM escape.
03:30
If your entire network is virtualized, there is
03:33
no physical boundary between certain systems.
03:36
With physically segmented systems, it is impossible for an
03:40
attacker to leap between segments without physical access.
03:43
With virtual segmentation, an attacker only
03:46
needs to know of an exploit that allows the leap.<br>
6. Summary
03:50
That's it for this lesson.
03:52
In this lesson, we looked at virtual networking devices.
03:55
We looked at protocol-based virtualization,
03:58
virtual switches, and virtual routers.
04:01
We looked at how these virtual devices
04:03
can benefit a networking environment.
04:06
And we finished by looking at some of the
04:08
drawbacks of virtual networking devices.<br>
