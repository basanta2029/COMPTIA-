1. Use Windows Sandbox
00:04
As an IT administrator, you'll often be asked to install
00:07
new software on the Windows systems running in your office.
00:09
Before installing any new software you're
00:11
unfamiliar with, it's always important to first
00:14
test the software to see how it will function.
00:17
This can be done using Hyper -V virtual machines,
00:19
but that requires the extra steps of installing
00:22
the operating system and getting things ready.
00:25
It also requires additional space on
00:27
your disk to store the virtual machine.<br>
00:29
To make testing software easier, Microsoft
00:32
offers a lightweight desktop environment known
00:34
as Windows Sandbox, where you can safely run
00:37
applications in an isolated environment.
00:40
The beauty of using Windows Sandbox is that once Windows
00:42
Sandbox is closed, all the software and files that were
00:45
added when the application was installed are deleted.
00:48
This means you get a brand-new instance of the
00:50
sandbox every time you open the application.<br>
2. Windows Sandbox Installation
00:53
To use Windows Sandbox, you must
00:55
add this feature to your system.<br>
00:56
To do this, first, open the Settings app.
00:59
Next, select Apps.
01:01
Now, from the right, select Optional features.
01:04
From this page, scroll down and
01:06
select More Windows features.
01:08
It's from here that you can add or remove features.<br>
01:11
From this dialog, scroll down and
01:12
select Windows Sandbox and click OK.
01:15
If the Windows Sandbox option is unavailable, your computer
01:17
doesn't meet the requirements to run Windows Sandbox.
01:21
As you can see, after the feature has been
01:23
installed, you'll be required to restart
01:25
your system, so I'll click Restart now.<br>
3. Run Windows Sandbox
01:36
With the computer restarted, you can now use Windows
01:38
Sandbox to install and test a new application.
01:41
To do this, let's click on Start and select All apps.
01:45
I'll then go down and run Windows Sandbox.
01:52
Notice that the Windows Sandbox window is
01:54
opened, which looks like another Windows machine.<br>
01:57
For this demo, I'm going to install the Audacity program.
02:00
To save time, I've already downloaded the
02:02
install file for this program and saved it
02:04
to my Downloads folder on the host computer.
02:06
Let's copy and paste this to the desktop of our sandbox.
02:16
Now, let's maximize the sandbox window for easier viewing.<br>
02:20
From this point, you simply install the application
02:22
as you would in a normal Windows environment.
02:24
So, let's double-click on the install file and
02:27
follow the remaining prompts to install Audacity.
02:39
Once the application has been installed, I can
02:41
test it to verify it didn't have any ill effects on
02:44
my system and functioned the way I wanted it to.<br>
02:47
When you're done testing your application,
02:49
all you need to do is close Windows Sandbox.
02:52
Notice that when you do, you're warned that
02:54
all your changes will be permanently lost.
02:56
That's fine, so I'll click OK.<br>
02:59
Just to verify that everything was
03:01
deleted, let's open Windows Sandbox again.
03:04
This time let's use the Search
03:05
feature to find and open this tool.
03:12
Notice that the installation file for Audacity is
03:14
gone, as well as the shortcut to run the program.
03:17
And when I access All apps, you can
03:19
see that Audacity isn't available.<br>
4. Summary
03:22
That's it for this demonstration.
03:23
In this demo, we showed you how to
03:25
install the Windows Sandbox feature.
03:27
We then showed you how to use Windows
03:28
Sandbox to install and test applications.<br>
