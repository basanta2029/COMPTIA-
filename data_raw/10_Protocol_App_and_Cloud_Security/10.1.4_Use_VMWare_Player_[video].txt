1. Use VMware Player
00:04
In this demo, we'll be working with VMware
00:06
Workstation Player, which is software that allows
00:09
the installation of virtual machines, or VMs.
00:13
This software is similar to commercially available
00:15
hypervisors, but on a much smaller scale.
00:19
VMware Workstation Player is designed to be used on
00:22
your desktop for either personal or business use.
00:25
Today, we'll just be looking at the standard
00:27
edition that you'd use in a home lab or for testing.<br>
2. Install a VM
00:31
Let's go ahead and walk through
00:33
a virtual machine installation.
00:35
We have several options off to the right.
00:37
Create a New Virtual Machine will start the
00:39
wizard to add a virtual machine to our player.
00:42
Open a Virtual Machine will add a virtual machine
00:44
that was already created elsewhere or with an open
00:47
virtual machine format, such as an .ovf file.
00:51
There's an upgrade option here to get Workstation Pro,
00:55
which gives you more features than would typically come with
00:57
VMware's ESXI hypervisor, but this requires a paid license.
01:03
You can always get help if you're feeling
01:05
stumped and want to check out more information.
01:07
We're going to go ahead and create a new VM.<br>
01:11
Typically, operating systems have an ISO
01:13
that's downloadable from their website.
01:16
We have some ISOs already downloaded,
01:18
so we're just going to click Browse.
01:20
We'll select our Win11 ISO file and click Open.
01:27
From here, we just need to click Next.
01:29
Quickly make sure that the Guest
01:30
operating system is set appropriately.
01:33
In our case, it'll be Microsoft Windows and
01:36
the version will be Windows 10 and later x64.
01:39
Click Next.<br>
01:42
Here it gives you an option to name the VM and its location.
01:46
Just to make things easier, I'll change the
01:48
name to Windows11 and leave the location alone.
01:51
Click Next.
01:53
Okay, this is one feature that's sort of unique.
01:56
We have the ability to store the VM's disk as a
01:58
single file or break it up into smaller files.
02:02
It says that it might be easier to move the smaller
02:04
files, but in our case, we just want to keep it as one.
02:08
Also, be mindful of how much disk space you
02:10
have on your workstation and how much you plan
02:12
to use in the future on this virtual machine.
02:16
There are usually bare bone
02:17
requirements for all operating systems.
02:19
Of course, you may want to add more
02:21
if there's another purpose to this VM.
02:23
Let's click Next.<br>
02:25
Notice that it didn't give me the
02:26
option to tweak more VM settings.
02:29
If you do want to finetune things more, like adding
02:31
more CPU or memory, tweaking the network, etc., you can
02:35
customize the hardware here or do it after the fact by
02:39
right-clicking on the VM and going to Settings.
02:42
Click Finish.<br>
3. Customize VM
02:44
Now we have a newly created VM ready to boot.
02:47
Let's go over the Settings that we have.
02:51
Some of this is self-explanatory, like adding or
02:53
removing Memory, Processors, or even Hard Disk space.
02:58
The Network Adapter is where it gets interesting.
03:01
There are many types of network connections to choose from.
03:04
Bridged connects directly to the physical network card,
03:07
NAT shares the host's IP address, Host-only puts the VM
03:12
in an isolated private network, Custom drops it in a
03:16
virtual network, and LAN segment does something similar.
03:20
NAT may be your best choice if your VM just
03:22
needs to reach the internet and isn't going
03:24
to be used in conjunction with other VMs.
03:26
If you want to network several VMs together, you
03:29
can use a custom virtual network or LAN segment.<br>
03:32
For example, if I wanted to create a firewall VM
03:35
that all my VMs go through first before they hit the
03:38
internet, I might have two network adapters in here.
03:42
One of them would be the NAT, the internet
03:45
source, while the secondary one would be the LAN
03:47
or a custom virtual network of my choosing.
03:49
Then all the other VMs would use the
03:51
virtual network and not the NAT connection.<br>
03:54
In our demo, we're just going
03:56
to leave it on NAT and click OK.<br>
4. Boot the VM
04:01
Now it's time to power this on.
04:04
Clicking Play virtual machine makes it come alive.
04:07
And just like that, we're booting the Windows
04:09
11 ISO to start the installation process.
04:12
Keep in mind that you have to leave
04:14
the player open to run these VMs.
04:17
These aren't meant to run what they call "headless"
04:18
and in the background with VMware Workstation player.
04:23
Once this application is closed
04:24
out, your VMs close out as well.<br>
5. Summary
04:27
That's it for this demo on virtual machines.
04:30
In this demo, we discovered VMware Workstation Player.
04:33
We also showed you how to install
04:35
a VM and tweak its settings.<br>
