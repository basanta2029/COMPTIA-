1. Enhancing Cloud Performance
00:04
In this video, we're going to look at five different ways
00:06
the cloud is being enhanced with technologies for
00:09
performance: fog computing, edge computing, serverless
00:13
architecture, services integration, and resource policies.
00:17
Let's get started.<br>
2. Fog Computing
00:19
Fog computing, also known as fogging, is
00:22
the cloud plus the Internet of Things.<br>
00:24
Fog is a new distributed architecture that extends
00:27
services offered in the cloud to edge devices.
00:30
Fog nodes are made up of intelligence,
00:33
computing power, and storage resources.
00:35
This can be in the form of routers or smart
00:37
gateways that communicate with the cloud.<br>
00:40
These fog nodes might, for example, process signals
00:43
coming in from sensors in a certain part of a city
00:47
to measure CO2 emissions and then send alerts.<br>
00:49
Edge devices are designed to
00:52
accomplish specific tasks using apps.
00:55
They come in all shapes and sizes, from
00:57
smartwatches to autonomous cars to smart buildings.
01:01
Edge devices can also be routers, switches, or firewalls.
01:05
Fog computing uses decentralized local
01:07
network architectures to speed up the analysis
01:10
and retrieval of data near the source.<br>
01:13
With growing 5G Wireless networking and embedded
01:16
artificial intelligence, we're about to have
01:18
billions of apps and devices coming online and a
01:21
tsunami of data that needs to be processed.
01:24
Fog can help with that.<br>
01:26
With fog, critical core functions are distributed.
01:29
Computing, communications, control, storage, and decision
01:33
making are all close to where the data originates locally.
01:37
Smart devices and sensors are being developed so the
01:40
components can instantly interact via wireless networks.<br>
3. Benefits of Fog Computing
01:44
Fog promises to be a revolutionary new
01:46
way of connecting, living, and working.
01:49
Its benefits over cloud computing include lower
01:52
latency, greater security, and enhanced capacity.
01:56
Since fog nodes are physically closer to devices
01:59
in the network, users can enjoy much lower latency
02:02
with instant responses to their computing needs.<br>
02:05
Fog provides greater security mainly because the data
02:08
travels a much shorter distance in a distributed network.
02:12
With fog, the storage capacity
02:13
of the cloud is also enhanced.
02:16
For example, a smart vehicle in trial right now is
02:19
currently generating 35 gigabytes of data per hour.
02:23
Secure fog computing has the power and
02:25
reach to process this amount of data.<br>
02:28
In addition, fog has the monitoring, detecting, and
02:31
reporting capabilities to provide real-time incident response
02:35
for security breaches, allowing it to quickly detect and
02:38
isolate threats and minimize disruption of services.<br>
4. Fog Security
02:42
While fog computing has many positive aspects, it also
02:45
inherits a cornucopia of security issues from cloud
02:48
computing: account hijacking, denial of service, access
02:52
control issues, unsecure APIs, system and application
02:56
vulnerabilities, shared technology issues, and much more.<br>
5. Edge Computing
03:00
Now let's discuss Edge computing.
03:03
Edge computing is performed at or near
03:05
the source of the data, not in the cloud.
03:08
It's a component of fog computing where the architecture
03:11
is distributed with decentralized processing power.
03:14
We capture, store, process, and analyze the data
03:17
near the client, where the data is usually generated.<br>
03:21
From the wearable on your wrist to streaming video
03:23
optimization, from controlling intersection traffic flow to
03:27
smart homes and buildings, edge computing's future is
03:30
exponentially expanding with the Internet of Everything,
03:34
artificial intelligence, 5G, robotics, machine learning, and
03:38
all the other technological developments taking place now.<br>
03:42
For edge devices to be smart, they must look
03:44
at incoming data, process it effectively,
03:47
share it, and take some sort of action.
03:49
Edge computing means the edge devices take these actions
03:52
without requiring data to be transported elsewhere.
03:55
Using a hub and spoke model, the cloud is the hub, and
03:59
everything outside the spokes is the edge, like a spiderweb.
04:02
Think of it like this: edge computing is about
04:05
processing the data locally, where cloud computing
04:08
is focused on processing data in a remote data
04:10
center that's a public or private cloud.<br>
6. Benefits of Edge Computing
04:13
There are many benefits of edge computing.
04:16
And much like fog computing, these include
04:18
lower latency, increased bandwidth, greater
04:21
resiliency, and data sovereignty.<br>
04:23
Data sovereignty is the ability to own and
04:26
manage your own data, and companies are very
04:28
concerned about making sure their data remains
04:30
theirs regardless of the technology they utilize.<br>
04:34
Edge also empowers workloads that need
04:36
processing in near real time, like autonomous
04:39
cars communicating with each other.
04:41
This speed and efficiency allows organizations to make more
04:44
impactful and timely decisions, which reduces costs, helps
04:48
them better engage with customers, and increases privacy.<br>
7. Security Risks of Edge Computing
04:52
Edge computing also suffers from many of the
04:55
same security risks as fog and cloud computing.<br>
8. Serverless Architecture
04:58
Another way to enhancing cloud performance is by using
05:02
serverless architecture, or serverless computing.
05:05
It lets you build and run your apps and services without
05:08
having to actually manage the infrastructure they run on.
05:11
Yes, your apps are still running on a server, but
05:14
you don't have to take care of it or its components.<br>
05:17
Instead, your cloud provider takes care of all the server
05:20
provisioning management, leaving your developers to focus
05:23
on what they do best: creating their core product.
05:26
And this saves them precious time and energy.<br>
05:29
Basically, a serverless architecture eliminates most of
05:32
the infrastructure management tasks of server provisioning,
05:36
patching, OS and database maintenance, storage, and more.
05:39
The cloud service provider takes care of
05:42
fault tolerance and high availability.<br>
05:45
Ultimately, serverless architecture reduces costs
05:48
and frees the company and its developers to focus
05:51
on product innovation and a faster time to market.
05:54
This gives them great agility and
05:56
responsiveness while they enjoy automatic
05:59
application scaling and market competitiveness.<br>
06:02
The serverless model is often referred to as Backend
06:05
as a Service, or BaaS, meaning that companies simply
06:09
pay for the resources consumed on the back end.
06:12
Companies can also rent functions and compute
06:15
runtimes, known as Function as a Service, or FaaS.
06:19
This allows companies to execute application
06:21
logic, but none of their data is stored.
06:24
Major FaaS vendors are Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft.<br>
9. Benefits of Services Integration
06:30
Benefits of cloud services integration include
06:33
synchronized data and apps, increased agility, faster time
06:36
to market, improved operational efficiency, reduced
06:40
operational costs, increased flexibility, and scalability.
06:44
Whether single-cloud or multi-cloud focused,
06:48
businesses are enjoying the tremendous, feature-rich
06:50
benefits of cloud services integration.<br>
10. Drawbacks of Serverless
06:54
While there are many positive aspects to
06:56
serverless, there are a few drawbacks.<br>
06:59
The first is performance.
07:00
Some code could suffer from latency because
07:03
the cloud provider typically spins down the
07:05
serverless code while it's not in use.
07:07
If the code you need has to take time
07:09
to start up, that will cause a delay.
07:12
Also, serverless may not be appropriate for some workloads,
07:16
like high-performance computing, due to resource limits.<br>
07:20
The next drawback is security.<br>
07:21
In serverless computing, the total attack
07:24
surface is due to each component being an
07:27
entry point to the serverless application.
07:29
Some of these would include network
07:31
sniffing, man-in-the-middle attack, phishing,
07:34
SQL injection, DDoS, and code exploit.
07:38
Further, because of limitations, companies can't implement
07:42
an intrusion detection/prevention system, or IDS/IPS.<br>
07:47
The next challenge is privacy.
07:49
Many serverless environments use proprietary public
07:52
cloud environments, and resources are often shared.
07:56
To overcome this, serverless computing can be
07:59
done on private clouds or even on-premeses, which
08:02
allows companies full control over system privacy.<br>
11. Services Integration
08:06
Integration with the cloud has really grown in popularity
08:10
as Software as a Service solutions continue to increase.
08:14
More businesses are running a hybrid mix of
08:16
on-premises apps and SaaS apps, and this is creating a
08:21
much greater need for innovative integration methods.<br>
12. Integration Types and Methods
08:24
There are three major integration types of cloud
08:26
technologies: cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-prem,
08:30
and a hybrid combination of the two.
08:32
Data and app integration needs are the core
08:35
concern when you're choosing from these strategies.
08:38
Businesses can build their own integration solutions for
08:41
their enterprise, or they can employ a third-party provider
08:44
with a solution that's reusable, agile, and scalable.
08:48
More than likely, integrating with the cloud
08:50
could be far more cost-effective as well.<br>
13. Security issues with Integration
08:53
However, data and apps need to be protected
08:56
from internal and external threats.
08:58
Misconfigurations can open
09:00
devastating security vulnerabilities.
09:03
A good cloud access security broker, or CASB, can
09:07
be a dedicated security solution that monitors and
09:10
automates security configuration audits.<br>
14. Resource Policies
09:13
A resource policy is attached to a specific
09:16
resource where you can specify who has
09:18
access to it and what they can do with it.
09:21
This helps to lock down applications and data on
09:23
mobile devices and integrate with cloud resources.
09:27
You can create policies in something like Microsoft
09:30
Intune and then roll them out to all your users.
09:34
This includes your users who would
09:35
like to bring your own device, or BYOD.<br>
09:40
You can keep your corporate apps and data
09:42
secure and encrypted on these devices,
09:44
regardless of the OS Android, IoS, or Windows.
09:48
Policies are usually applied to
09:50
groups of users or groups of devices.
09:53
If you're using Microsoft Intune for your resource
09:56
policies, you'll need to integrate with Azure
09:59
Active Directory services in the Azure cloud.<br>
15. Summary
10:03
That's it for this lesson.
10:04
In this lesson, we looked at other technologies
10:07
that enhance cloud performance like fog computing,
10:09
edge computing, and serverless architecture.
10:12
We also discussed services integration, and
10:15
we ended by exploring resource policies.
10:18
The cloud will continue to expand, and more options
10:21
will become available to enhance its performance.<br>
