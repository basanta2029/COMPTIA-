1. Communication of Embedded Systems
00:04
Now that we have a better understanding of embedded
00:06
systems, it's time to dive deeper into the technologies
00:09
and protocols that allow them to communicate.<br>
00:12
Embedded systems often require new technologies, and
00:15
their biggest obstacle is the lack of capable support.
00:19
For this reason, they currently
00:20
use standard networking protocols.
00:22
These protocols are divided into four categories:
00:25
short-range, medium-range, long-range, and wired.<br>
2. Short-Range Protocols
00:28
There are several short-range protocols and technologies.
00:32
Near-field communication, or NFC, and
00:35
radio-frequency identification, or RFID, are two
00:38
very simple, low-energy, and versatile protocols.
00:41
RFID uses two-way radio transmitter
00:44
receivers to identify and track object tags.
00:47
NFC uses magnetic field induction to communicate
00:51
between mobile and standard electronic devices.<br>
00:54
Bluetooth Low Energy, also known as BLE or Bluetooth
00:57
Smart, is a wireless personal area network.
01:01
It supports low-power, long-use IoT technology.
01:04
It's used in the healthcare, security,
01:06
entertainment, and fitness sectors.<br>
01:08
Light-Fidelity, or Li-Fi, is very similar to Wi-Fi.
01:12
The two key differences are speed and mode of communication.
01:16
Unlike Wi-Fi, Li-Fi is a visible
01:18
light communications system.
01:20
It uses light bulbs to transfer data at
01:22
the high speed of 224 gigabits per second.<br>
01:26
Quick Response, or QR, codes and
01:28
barcodes are tags attached to products.
01:30
They're machine-readable and contain
01:32
information about the product.
01:34
A QR code is two-dimensional, and you can scan
01:36
it using a smartphone, while barcodes come in
01:38
one-dimensional or two-dimensional code.<br>
01:40
Thread, Zigbee, and Z-Wave are all radio protocols
01:44
that create low-rate private area networks.
01:47
Their advantage is that, although they're
01:48
low-power, they offer high throughput.
01:51
Thread uses an IPv6-based networking protocol.
01:55
Zigbee is a short-range communication
01:57
protocol based on the IEEE 203.15.4 standard.
02:02
Z-Wave is a low-power, short-range communication
02:05
protocol designed mostly for home IoT systems.<br>
02:09
Wi-Fi is commonly implemented in
02:11
wireless local area networking.
02:13
The most common Wi-Fi standard is 802.11n
02:17
with a maximum speed of 600 Megabits per
02:19
second and a range of about 50 meters.<br>
02:22
Wi-Fi Direct uses peer-to-peer communication
02:25
without a set wireless access point.
02:27
The devices in Wi-Fi Direct only start communicating after
02:30
an access point device has been selected within the system.<br>
02:34
You can also use hotspots to
02:36
provide wireless network access.<br>
02:38
Mobile hotspots let you connect a device to the internet
02:40
through a portable wireless device such as a phone.<br>
02:44
Hotspots form an on-the-spot Wi-Fi network, allowing you to
02:47
connect a number of gadgets for simple, fast internet access.
02:50
Hotspots often use third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation
02:54
technology to provide this type of connection.
02:56
5G is the best of them because it achieves
02:59
speeds twenty times faster that 4G; its
03:01
peak speed is 20 gigabytes per second.
03:04
It uses LTE for wireless connections and includes lower
03:07
frequencies than previous generations, down to 600 Megahertz.<br>
3. Medium-Range Protocols
03:11
There are two main protocols in the
03:13
medium-range category, HaLow and LTE-Advanced.
03:13
HaLow is a branch of Wi-Fi with extended range.
03:19
It's most useful in rural areas because it uses low data
03:22
rates, so it reduces power and cost for transmission.
03:25
LTE-Advanced is a mobile communication.
03:29
It makes standard LTE better because it has
03:31
a greater capacity for data rate, extended
03:33
range, efficiency, and performance.<br>
4. Long-Range Protocols
03:36
Long-range wireless communication offers a
03:38
few different protocols and technologies.
03:40
The first one we'll talk about is LPWAN.
03:43
LPWAN stands for low-power wide-area networking.
03:47
It's a wireless telecommunication network.
03:49
There are three protocols associated
03:51
with LPWAN: LoRaWAN, Sigfox, and Neul.<br>
03:54
LoRaWAN stands for long-range wide-area network.
03:58
It's used with mobile, industrial
04:00
machine-to-machine, and secure two-way communication
04:02
for IoT devices, smart cities, and healthcare.
04:05
Sigfox is good for devices with short battery
04:08
life that need to transfer low-level data.
04:11
Neul uses a small part of the TV white space
04:14
spectrum and delivers high-quality, high-power,
04:16
high-coverage networks at a low cost.
04:19
Next, there's Very Small Aperture Terminal, or VSAT.
04:22
VSAT uses small dish antennas to
04:25
transfer broadband and narrowband data.<br>
04:28
And finally, there's cellular.
04:30
This communication protocol can send and receive
04:32
high-quality data over very long distances.
04:35
However, it's very expensive and consumes a lot of power.<br>
5. Wired Communication
04:39
Next we're going to talk about wired communication.
04:41
There are three main protocols in this category:
04:44
Ethernet; Multimedia over Coax Alliance, or MoCA;
04:48
and Power-line Communication, or PLC.<br>
04:51
Ethernet is used in LANs.
04:53
The speed, signaling, media access methods, and
04:55
cable lengths are defined in the various Ethernet
04:58
standards published by the IEEE 802.3 committee.
05:02
There are many Ethernet specifications,
05:04
but they all use a common naming standard.
05:06
The word BASE is in the middle.
05:08
This indicates that the standard uses
05:10
baseband signaling, not broadband signaling.
05:13
Baseband updates may improve or diminish battery
05:16
performance, network signal strength, and roaming capability.<br>
05:19
Then we have MoCA.
05:21
As its name suggests, MoCA uses coaxial
05:23
cables to provide high-definition videos
05:26
of a home and other content related to it.<br>
05:29
PLC uses electrical wires to transmit
05:31
power and data from one point to another.
05:33
PLC is used in different sectors like automation,
05:36
industrial, and broadband over power lines, or BLP.<br>
6. SIM Cards
05:41
One last form of embedded device communication
05:43
worth mentioning isn't a protocol; it's a card
05:45
many devices carry inside them called a
05:48
Subscriber Identity Module card, or SIM card.
05:51
It encrypts data transmission and stores
05:52
information about the owner of the device the SIM
05:55
card is in for identification and authentication.
05:59
It also stores the International
06:00
Mobile Subscriber Identity, or IMSI.
06:03
This is a unique identifier that defines a subscriber in the
06:06
wireless world, including their country and mobile network.<br>
7. Summary
06:10
That's it for this lesson.
06:11
Today, we discussed the communication of embedded systems.
06:14
We talked about short-range,
06:15
medium-range, and long-range protocols.
06:18
We also covered wired communication and SIM cards.
06:21
Embedded devices are complex.
06:23
Learning about their protocols, technologies,
06:25
and communication models will prepare you to
06:27
incorporate and safeguard them.<br>
