1. Embedded Device Security Constraints
00:04
Embedded systems are usually dedicated
00:06
to performing a precise function.
00:08
They can vary in size, complexity, and function
00:11
and can range from tiny, portable devices like
00:13
smart watches to large traffic controllers.
00:17
Some have low complexity, like a single
00:19
micro-controller chip that opens and closes a
00:21
gate, and some have very high complexity, like
00:24
the embedded systems in an automated aircraft.<br>
00:27
Nowadays, devices are becoming more
00:28
intelligent and capable than ever.
00:31
Manufacturers are always competing to be the
00:33
first to release the latest and greatest device.
00:35
But in the process of beating their
00:37
competitors to market, many end up neglecting
00:39
some of the most important security issues.
00:42
These circumstances make it so devices are
00:44
often sent out unchecked and undertested,
00:47
making them easy for hackers to exploit.<br>
00:49
In this lesson, I'll go over some of the security
00:51
constraints that affect modern embedded devices.<br>
2. Security Issues
00:55
Smart devices collect data for many reasons, such as
00:58
improving efficiency, experience, and decision-making.
01:01
Again, the problem is that some devices lack the
01:03
most basic security and data-protection policies.
01:06
Because you're dealing with sensitive
01:08
information, you absolutely have to store and
01:09
process data securely across your network.
01:13
This means that you should redact
01:14
sensitive data before you store it.
01:15
An alternative is to use data separation to decouple
01:19
personally identifiable information from data payloads.
01:23
Data that isn't useful anymore should
01:25
be disposed of in a safe manner.
01:27
No measure is ever fail-proof, and every device needs
01:30
regular patches to address attacks that uncover new flaws.<br>
3. Security Issues
01:33
Patching has its downsides as well, and
01:35
many times a patch ends up causing just as
01:38
many problems as it was intended to solve.
01:40
First of all, the patch might
01:42
break the device's functionality.
01:44
Second, most manufacturers are more concerned
01:46
with producing and releasing products faster than
01:48
their competition than mitigating security risks.
01:52
Third, manufacturers often stop releasing
01:54
patches and support for devices once they
01:57
start working on a different product.
01:58
Fourth, many devices use unsupported legacy Linux kernels.<br>
02:03
Ideally, each device should undergo proper
02:05
testing before it's released to the market,
02:07
and patches should happen on a regular basis.
02:10
But, sometimes the cost to go through all the testing
02:12
is more than manufacturers are willing to spend.
02:15
Many times, they simply accept the risks,
02:17
even though skipping these important steps
02:19
is bad for customers and manufacturers.
02:22
After all, it only takes one large-scale data
02:24
breach for a company to lose sensitive information,
02:27
the public's trust, and maybe their entire fortune.<br>
4. Authentication
02:31
For this reason, you should always implement
02:33
secure authentication for users and apps.
02:36
Authentication is an area that's often
02:38
overlooked in embedded-technology development.
02:41
The Mirai botnet was one of the biggest and
02:43
most troublesome DDoS attacks in recent history.
02:46
This attack was so successful because it found
02:48
vulnerable IoT devices and used default usernames
02:51
and passwords to log in and infect them.<br>
02:54
Although almost all devices have to authenticate before they
02:57
access a network, many allow easy-to-guess default passwords.
03:01
The main problem is that there's no set regulation for
03:04
smart devices that companies are legally forced to abide by.
03:07
With this in mind, some ways to strengthen
03:09
your own authentication practices are to
03:12
use two-factor authentication, enforce
03:14
strong passwords, and use certificates.<br>
5. Encryption
03:17
Even if you secure your devices with authentication,
03:19
there's another vulnerability called lack of encryption.
03:23
Data encryption and decryption is an ongoing process.
03:26
Most network sensors aren't capable of
03:28
supporting this process, which means that most
03:30
data is transferred and received as cleartext.
03:33
In addition, ports listening to the internet
03:36
are many times left open continuously.
03:39
Both factors make data extremely vulnerable
03:41
to theft, breaches, and other malicious acts.<br>
6. Trust and Security
03:44
In order to try to standardize platforms and create trust
03:47
in the embedded world, a group of experts got together in
03:50
2003 and created the Trusted Computing Group, or TCG.
03:55
Together, they released a standard
03:56
called Trusted Platform Module, or TPM.
03:59
Although trust and security are often spoken of as
04:02
one and the same, they're actually quite different.<br>
04:05
Consider the fact that a secure system that can
04:07
be bypassed without detection isn't trustworthy.
04:10
At the same time, a trusted system with
04:12
undiscovered vulnerabilities isn't secure.<br>
04:14
To be trusted, a system must behave as expected
04:18
and be able to detect that something is wrong.
04:20
That's why TPM is so valuable to trusted computing.
04:23
It provides essential services such as strong
04:26
identity, secure storage, and integrity measurement.<br>
7. Summary
04:29
That's it for this video.
04:31
As embedded devices grow and develop, they
04:33
become more susceptible to exploitation
04:35
from hackers and other bad actors.
04:37
Understanding the present challenges in the world
04:40
of embedded devices can help you protect your data
04:42
and stand out in your technological career.<br>
