1. Restart, Retire, or Wipe Devices
00:04
There are times when it may be necessary to remove company
00:07
data from a device that is assigned to one of your users.
00:10
Now, you could jump in a cab and go to the
00:12
person's house, knock on the door, and demand to
00:14
see the device, or you could use some of the
00:16
cool features that Microsoft has created for us.
00:19
In this demo, we're going to look at how to restart,
00:21
retire, or wipe devices on a device remotely.<br>
2. Retire a Device
00:25
I'm already logged into Endpoint Manager.
00:27
I'll come up to Devices and go
00:29
over to the All Devices blade.
00:31
Then, in my list of devices, select the Windows11-3 device.
00:35
There is no particular reason why
00:37
I picked this device for this demo.
00:39
In your environment, you would obviously
00:40
pick the one that you want to work with.<br>
00:43
So, now we're seeing some of the
00:43
basic properties for this device.
00:45
I can do several things from here.
00:47
Up here, we have Retire.
00:49
I'll click on it.
00:50
If you choose this option, it will remove company
00:52
data from the device that is managed by Intune.
00:55
It won't delete the user's personal data.
00:58
There are some exceptions to what is removed,
01:00
so make sure you read the documentation and
01:02
understand what's happening before proceeding.<br>
01:04
I don't want to do this, so I'll click No.<br>
3. Wipe a Device
01:06
Now we'll look at how to wipe a device.
01:09
I'll click on Wipe.
01:11
Now a wipe is going to set the
01:12
device back to a factory reset.
01:15
You might do this if the person using the
01:16
device has had an awkward dismissal from a
01:18
company or the device is lost or stolen.
01:21
You have two choices.
01:22
You can wipe the device, but keep the
01:24
enrollment state and associated account.
01:26
The other option is to wipe even if the device loses power.
01:30
It also says that the device
01:32
might not run Windows 10 or later.
01:34
This is the more extreme of the two.
01:36
It's probably the right option
01:38
if the device is lost or stolen.
01:40
In fact, it's making me a little nervous.
01:42
I'm going to click Cancel before I
01:44
accidentally wipe my demo system!<br>
4. Delete a Device
01:47
Next, we have Delete a device.
01:49
This one deletes the device, and you
01:51
will no longer see it here in Intune.
01:53
The device will no longer be able to reach company
01:55
resources, and the company data may be wiped from the device.<br>
5. Other Options
01:59
We're going to look at the Restart feature,
02:01
but first, let's talk about a few others.
02:04
Here, we have Sync.
02:06
Use this when you want to sync your device.
02:08
Fresh Start will remove all preloaded Win32 apps.
02:12
You can choose whether to retain user data or not.
02:15
And finally, there are several
02:16
more things you can do remotely.
02:17
Now let's go back and look at
02:19
how to restart a device remotely.<br>
6. Restart Device Remotely with Intune
02:22
Now I'll click on Restart.
02:24
I get a message here that basically asks if
02:26
I'm sure about wanting to restart the device.
02:29
It goes on to say that the users will not be automatically
02:31
notified of the restart, and they might lose work.
02:34
To prevent this, make sure your users are
02:36
informed before you select this option.
02:39
I know that there is no one using this device,
02:41
so I'll go ahead and click on Yes here.
02:44
You can see a message in the upper right-hand
02:45
corner of the screen that says Initializing Restart.
02:49
Now I'll jump over this this
02:50
other device and see what happens.<br>
02:53
Okay.
02:54
I'm on the Windows client here, and
02:55
I've been waiting for a few minutes.
02:57
It did not reboot instantly.
02:58
I do have this message that says it's going to sign
03:01
me out and Windows will shut down in two minutes.
03:03
So, I'll pause the recording, wait for
03:05
a few minutes, and see what happens.<br>
03:07
Oay., That took about two minutes,
03:10
and now my device is restarting.<br>
7. Summary
03:13
That's it for this demo.
03:14
In this demonstration, we covered the
03:15
steps on how to restart, retire, or wipe
03:18
devices on a device remotely in Intune.<br>
