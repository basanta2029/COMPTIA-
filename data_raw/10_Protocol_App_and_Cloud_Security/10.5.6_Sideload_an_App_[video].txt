1. Sideload an App in Windows 10
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll walk through the process
00:07
of sideloading an app on a Windows 10 workstation system.
00:10
Sideloading is the act of installing apps that we create or
00:13
own on a Windows system without going through the Microsoft
00:16
Store. This is a significant change from earlier versions of
00:20
Windows, such as Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.
00:23
In Windows 8 and 8.1, sideloading an app was discouraged,
00:27
and was therefore very difficult to implement. On Windows
00:29
10 that has all changed. Sideloading is relatively easy
00:33
now. With that in mind, let's walk through the process
00:36
that you need to follow in order to sideload an app.
2. Configure Windows to Allow Sideloading in Windows Settings
00:39
The first thing we must do is configure Windows
00:42
to allow sideloading because sideloading is
00:44
typically not allowed by default. To do this,
00:47
you right-click Start and select Settings app.
00:52
Then go to Update and Security > For
00:53
Developers. Here you have three options.
00:57
First, there is Microsoft Store apps, then
01:00
Sideload apps, and finally Developer mode.
01:03
This is already set to allow Sideloading
01:05
apps, so we don't have to change anything.
01:07
On some versions of Windows, the top option,
01:10
Microsoft Store, is set as the default.
01:12
When you change to Sideload apps, you get a message
01:15
warning of the danger of installing an app by sideloading
01:18
rather than going through the Microsoft Store.
01:21
You can also go into Developer mode.
01:23
It is similar to the sideloading option, but it
01:25
also includes advanced development features, which
01:28
we're not going to work with today. We're just going
01:30
to use the Sideload apps option. Close this window.
3. Configure Windows to Allow Sideloading in Group Policy
01:34
There is another way you can enable sideloading an
01:36
app and that is through the Group Policy Editor.
01:39
The great thing about Group Policy is that if you do this
01:41
on the domain, all systems on the domain that are assigned
01:44
this Group Policy will be able to sideload an app.
01:47
Deciding if you want to do that or not
01:49
depends on the number of systems involved.
01:51
To show you how to do that, we'll go into
01:53
the Local Group Policy and configure this.
01:56
Remember, you typically would do this on
01:58
the server, but the settings are the same.
02:00
Go down to Search, type ‘gpedit', and then
02:03
select Edit Group Policy from the list.
02:06
The Local Group Policy Editor opens.
02:08
We'll adjust the size so we can see things better.
02:11
Under Computer Configuration, expand
02:13
Administrative Templates, Windows Components
02:16
and select App Package Deployment.
02:20
Next, double-click this setting right
02:22
here, Allow all trusted apps to install.
02:25
When the dialog box opens you will see
02:27
that by default it's set to Not Configured.
02:30
We can enable it here, if we want.
02:31
We're not going to enable it because
02:33
we already did in the Settings App.
02:35
This is just another way of doing it,
02:37
especially if your system is part of a domain.
02:40
As always, down here under Help, you can read more
02:43
about what this setting does if you are not sure.
02:45
Let's exit out of these windows now.
02:47
With sideloading enabled, now we can practice
02:50
sideloading an app. First, you must have an app to
02:53
sideload. We've already done that on this system. You
02:56
could create your own app, but who has time for that?
02:59
For this demo, we downloaded one
03:00
and saved it to the hard disk.
03:02
Key thing here is that we did not use the Microsoft Store.
03:06
We determined where this app was
03:07
hosted on the web and downloaded it.
03:10
Note that this app has an APPX file extension.
03:13
This file is the app that we're going to sideload.
4. View the Security Certificate
03:16
Before continuing, we want to check
03:18
the security certificate for this app.
03:20
We downloaded the app from the internet, so, you want to
03:23
make sure the digital signature is OK before you install it.
03:26
Also keep in mind, if this was an app that we created, we'd
03:30
have to create a certificate and install that certificate.
03:33
Without a certificate, Windows
03:35
will not allow that app to install.
03:37
We know this because we tried to do it and guess what?
03:39
It doesn't work.
03:41
There are probably work arounds to make it
03:43
work but that is beyond the scope of this demo.
03:45
So, let's check the digital signature of this app.
03:48
We'll right-click and go to Properties
03:50
and click the Digital Signatures tab.
03:54
Next, we'll select the certificate
03:56
in the Signature list box.
03:57
Click Details.
04:00
Under Digital Signature Information,
04:02
it says, "Hey, this signature is OK."
04:04
That's a positive thing and we should
04:06
not have any problems with our app.
04:09
Click Cancel to close the dialog box.
5. Sideload the App
04:13
So, now we have enabled sideloading on the system.
04:15
We've checked the certificate that was used
04:17
to sign the app and we've verified that the
04:20
signature on the app file is valid.
04:22
The next thing we must do is to sideload the app.
04:24
Starting with the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, you
04:28
can double click the APPX file and install the app.
04:31
When we do that, the app installer launches.
04:33
Here, you can see the name of the app,
04:35
publisher info, version, and some other info.
04:38
If we click Install, the app installs.
04:41
Let's do things the hard way.
04:43
We'll install this app using a PowerShell cmdlet.
04:46
The first thing we must do is run PowerShell.
04:49
Close the installer here.
04:51
We'll right-click the Start and then
04:52
click Windows PowerShell (Admin).
04:55
We'll elevate privileges and PowerShell opens.
04:58
To make things easier, we put the app into
05:01
a folder on the C: drive named Install.
05:03
Let's change directories and go to that folder.
05:06
To do that type ‘cd c:/Install' and press Enter.
05:12
Let's do a ‘dir' command to see the contents of the folder.
05:15
The APPX file is there.
05:17
This makes things easier as you will see in a minute.
05:20
Now that we're in the right directory, all we
05:22
do is type 'Add-AppPackage' followed by the name
05:25
of the package file that we want to install.
05:27
We type ‘./' and instead of typing out this long
05:31
filename, we'll highlight it, select Edit, right-click,
05:36
choose Copy, come down here and right-click.
05:39
When we do, it gets pasted in. Hit Enter and wait
05:42
a minute while the app is installed on the system.
05:50
Something happened, but are we sure?
05:52
Well, let's see if the app is installed.
05:55
We'll close these windows, click Start, and
05:59
scroll down to find the app we just installed.
06:01
Click it and it opens.
06:05
If for some reason we don't want this app any longer,
06:07
we can uninstall it like we do any Microsoft Store app.
06:13
You find it in the list, right-click, select
06:16
Uninstall, select it from the list again,
06:18
click Uninstall again, and the app is gone.
6. Summary
06:22
That's it for this demo.
06:24
In this demonstration we walked through the process
06:26
for sideloading an app on Windows 10. First, you
06:29
must have the app that you want to install.
06:31
Then you must enable sideloading.
06:33
You verify that the digital signature on the app
06:36
is valid, and then use the add appx
06:38
package PowerShell command to install the app file.
