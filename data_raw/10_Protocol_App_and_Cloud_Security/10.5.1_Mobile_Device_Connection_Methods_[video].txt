1. Mobile Device Considerations
00:04
Mobile devices pose a unique threat to modern networks.
00:06
The days when you only had to worry about static
00:09
workstations that sit in a cubicle are gone.
00:12
Instead, security professionals also have to worry about
00:15
countless mobile devices that can be brought in and out of
00:18
office and are subject to a host of security vulnerabilities.<br>
00:22
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at some
00:24
considerations you need to keep in mind when it comes to
00:26
mobile devices and the threats they pose to a network.<br>
2. Connection Methods
00:30
Let's first take a look at the various
00:32
connection methods used by mobile devices.
00:35
Mobile devices use a variety of ways to connect to
00:37
the internet, the network, and even other devices.<br>
00:40
You're probably familiar with
00:42
cellular and Wi-Fi connections.
00:44
This is something practically all
00:45
mobile devices are equipped with.
00:47
However, mobile devices can also use Bluetooth,
00:50
NFC, ANT, and infrared to communicate wirelessly.
00:55
And each of these connection methods have their own
00:58
set of security concerns you should be aware of.<br>
01:01
For example, Bluetooth is susceptible to Bluejacking
01:03
and Bluesnarfing, and NFC is susceptible to relay
01:08
attacks, data corruption, and eavesdropping.
01:11
So, when implementing mobile devices, be sure
01:13
to account for the various vulnerabilities
01:15
each of these connection methods have.<br>
01:17
One way to protect against these is to simply disable
01:20
these connection methods when they aren't being used.
01:23
This is probably the best way to protect against
01:25
attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in these systems.<br>
01:28
Another way to secure mobile device
01:30
communications is to employ proper security
01:33
settings and ensure the use of security protocols.
01:36
For example, make sure to only allow
01:38
connections with trusted devices.<br>
3. Location, Location, Location
01:41
Another thing to consider with mobile
01:42
devices is that of geolocation settings.<br>
01:46
Most mobile devices are equipped with GPS,
01:48
allowing them to use geolocation services.
01:51
This helps with certain apps, such
01:53
as maps and weather applications.
01:55
However, you can also use the GPS unit
01:58
in mobile devices for security purposes.<br>
02:00
For example, using a technique called geofencing, you can
02:04
lock mobile devices to a particular geographical area.
02:07
You specify a geographic area where the mobile device
02:10
is allowed to function a virtual boundary of sorts.
02:12
If the mobile device moves outside of that area, it can
02:16
either instruct the user to move back into that area, or
02:18
even lock the user out from accessing the device altogether.<br>
02:23
This functionality can be useful if you issue
02:25
mobile devices to employees, but don't want
02:28
them to be able to take them home to use.<br>
02:31
Geofencing can also be used to
02:33
trigger alerts or notifications.
02:34
For example, it can be used to remind a user to carry out
02:39
a particular task when they reach a geographic location.<br>
02:42
Geolocation services can be of great value to mobile
02:45
devices, but they also create some security concerns.
02:48
One of these concerns is that of
02:50
geolocation data embedded in images.<br>
02:53
See, when someone takes a photo on their phone or
02:55
mobile device, the geographic location where that
02:59
photo was taken is embedded in the image's EXIF data.
03:01
If the user was to upload this photo to the
03:04
internet, a malicious individual could use the EXIF
03:07
data to carry out a social engineering attack.<br>
03:10
To combat this, be sure to disable
03:12
geotagging on mobile devices.<br>
4. Compromised Devices
03:14
Another concern with mobile devices
03:16
is the fact that they are mobile.
03:18
Because users are able to take them home,
03:20
to the coffee shop, to wherever, they have
03:23
the added risk of being lost or stolen.
03:25
And if that device contains sensitive information or
03:28
company documents, you risk compromising that information.<br>
03:31
To protect against this threat,
03:33
you can do a couple of things.
03:34
First, you can employ full device encryption on
03:37
all mobile devices and require them to have some
03:40
type of screen lock and authentication method,
03:42
whether it's a pin, password, biometric, whatever.
03:46
Just make sure the device requires
03:48
authentication for access.<br>
03:50
Another thing you can do is require all mobile
03:53
devices to have some type of remote wipe feature.
03:55
Most mobile devices have built-in remote wipe
03:58
features, but you might also have to install a
04:01
third-party remote wipe feature if necessary.<br>
04:03
And lastly, mobile devices pose a risk for
04:06
organizations in the form of data exfiltration.<br>
04:09
For example, a disgruntled employee could use their
04:12
phone to take photos of sensitive information or transfer
04:15
documents to their phone via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB.
04:19
They could even use the device to
04:21
record sensitive conversations.<br>
04:23
If this is a concern for your organization, consider having
04:26
an extremely strict mobile device policy or only allow the
04:30
use of company-owned mobile devices on the premises.<br>
5. Summary
04:34
Mobile devices pose a unique threat to an organization.
04:37
And mobile device use is only
04:39
going to increase in the future.
04:40
Because of this, it's important that you understand the
04:43
threats that mobile devices pose to an organization and
04:46
the steps you can take to properly protect your network.<br>
