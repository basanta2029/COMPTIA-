1. Smart Devices
00:04
Everyone seeks convenience and connectivity whether
00:07
you are at work, home, in the car or wherever.
00:10
Smart devices are showing up nearly everywhere.
00:12
It could be your thermostat, light switches,
00:14
light bulbs, electrical plugs, security cameras,
00:17
door locks, sprinkler systems, and even digital
00:20
speakers such as Google Home or Amazon Echo.<br>
00:22
There are hundreds of these devices and
00:24
more coming on the market all the time.
00:26
It would be simply impossible to cover all of them, but
00:28
we are going to take a look at a few of them in this demo.<br>
2. Speaker and Digital Assistants
00:31
The first one, and one of the very
00:33
popular, is the Amazon Echo.
00:35
The Echo is a smart speaker that is controlled by voice.
00:38
It responds to voice commands when you use
00:40
a "wake word," which is normally Alexa.<br>
00:42
The device is capable of doing things such as playing
00:44
music, making a to-do list, setting alarms, providing
00:47
weather info, along with all sorts of other things.
00:50
It can also be used in conjunction with
00:52
other smart devices to control devices such
00:55
as lights, security cameras, and so on.
00:57
One of my favorite things to do at home is to use Bluetooth
01:00
to pair Alexa with my surround sound system and stream music.<br>
01:03
Most smart devices are managed with
01:05
an app and the Echo is no different.
01:07
Let's take a look at the Amazon
01:09
Echo app on an Android Device.
01:11
Here is a Google Pixel phone and
01:12
I have my Amazon Alexa app on it.
01:14
Let's go ahead and open it.<br>
01:15
The first thing I can see are some things to try,
01:18
followed by some of the recent things that it has done.
01:21
As you can see, we have some music lovers that use the Echo.<br>
01:24
Let's go up to our menu and then down at the bottom.
01:25
We will tap on our settings.
01:27
When we do that, we get a new screen.
01:29
The first thing we can look at is the Alexa account.
01:32
Here we do things such as train
01:33
Alexa to recognize our voice.
01:35
Perhaps we have an accent and want to
01:37
train Alexa to recognize it better.<br>
01:39
Below that, we can tell Alexa that it is
01:41
OK to use voice commands to purchase items.
01:44
If we go into that, we can see that we can
01:45
require a code confirming the purchase of items.
01:48
If that was not the case, I could see
01:50
some issues with impulse shopping.
01:52
Let's go back.<br>
01:53
Next is the Alexa Voice Responses.
01:56
Alexa is configured to respond in
01:58
short replies which is the default.<br>
02:00
The Amazon Household is a feature to allow other users
02:03
to use this device to do things such as purchase products
02:06
and services, using the Voice Purchasing feature.<br>
02:09
Below that is History.
02:11
Here you can see a list of things
02:12
that Alexa has been asked to do.
02:14
As you can see it can be quite detailed.
02:16
Although you must use the "wake word" first,
02:19
some feel that these smart speakers, may be
02:21
listening to us a little too much at times.<br>
02:23
The last selection will take you to the Amazon website where
02:26
you can view more history items, frequently asked questions,
02:30
the privacy notice, and the terms of use for the device.<br>
02:33
The Echo can work with other smart devices.
02:35
Let's tap down here on the lower
02:36
right on the Smart Devices Icon.<br>
02:39
The first thing we have is the Echo &amp; Alexa group.
02:41
If I tap on that, you can see that
02:44
I have a couple of Echo's connected.
02:45
If I tap on the first one, Dana's Echo, you can
02:48
then see some addition information such as connected
02:51
devices, the Wi-Fi information, and so on.
02:54
Let's go back a couple of screens.<br>
3. Smart Light
02:55
Next, we have Lights.
02:57
This is a smart light located on the front door of my home.
03:00
If I look at it, I can see that currently that light is on.
03:03
If I tap it, it will go off.
03:05
If I tap the icon below, Create a Routine, I could configure
03:09
this light to come on at night and go off during the day.
03:12
Now for this to work with this Echo, I had
03:14
to use the Set this up on the app that came
03:16
with the light, in order for this to work.<br>
03:18
I'm going to go back a few screens and tap on Plugs.
03:21
This is for a smart plug that is in
03:23
our home and connected to a lamp.
03:25
When I tap this here, I can turn this lamp off or on.
03:28
This is also configured to work with voice commands.
03:31
I can say, "Alexa, light off."
03:33
And she would turn that light off.<br>
03:35
If I tap on the Lamp, I can once again see that at
03:37
the bottom I can tap here to create a routine for
03:40
this plug to come off or on, either at certain times
03:43
or use specially configured voice commands to do so.<br>
03:47
Now, we saw how the smart plug was
03:49
connected and we had a lamp plugged into it.
03:51
Let's take a look at that app
03:53
and see how that is configured.
03:54
I'll exit my Amazon Echo app and go into my Smart Plug app.<br>
4. Smart Plugs
03:58
OK, we are in our app and here you can see
04:02
that I have one smart plug and I named it Lamp.
04:04
From this app, I can turn the plug, which
04:06
the lamp is plugged into, off and on.
04:09
The button is green letting me know that it is now on.<br>
04:12
If I had other smart devices from this
04:14
manufacturer, they would be listed here.
04:16
To add a device, I would tap the plus icon up here,
04:20
and here we can see a list of all the different
04:22
types of devices that I would be able to add.
04:25
I don't have any additional devices but if I
04:27
did, I would tap the type of device and this app
04:30
would walk me through the installation and setup.<br>
04:33
For example, if I had a smart bulb, I could just tap here.
04:36
You can see that it tells me what to do.
04:38
I don't have any of these, so I'll back out of here.<br>
04:41
Finally, if I tap on the selection, Works
04:43
with Kasa, I can see some of the other smart
04:45
devices that are compatible with this device.
04:48
You can see Amazon Alexa in this list.
04:50
As we saw earlier, this smart
04:52
plug works with my Amazon Echo.<br>
5. Smart Security Cameras
04:54
The final thing we will look at are some security cameras.
04:57
Once again, the manufacture uses a mobile device
05:00
app to setup and configure the security cameras.
05:03
The app is also used to view the video clips.<br>
05:06
Now this system has three cameras set up and configured.
05:09
Each one can be configured individually by
05:11
tapping these setting next to the main icon.
05:14
Here you can name each camera and check it's battery life.
05:17
This system uses batteries, so they can be installed
05:19
anywhere, as long as it can get my Wi-Fi signal.<br>
05:22
It also shows me the temperature where the camera
05:25
is mounted and if the camera is enabled or not.
05:28
The retrigger time is the amount of time between
05:31
the time it first senses motion and when I want it
05:34
to start recording again a second or third time.
05:36
I have this set to 10 seconds.<br>
05:38
Since the street is in view of the camera and we have
05:41
cars going by occasionally, I don't want it picking up
05:44
every single car, so I have the sensitivity set to 3.
05:48
Only large vehicles from the street set off this camera,
05:50
but it still picks up anything that comes in the front yard.<br>
05:53
The clip length is set to 25 seconds.
05:56
If there is more motion after that, the camera
05:58
will retrigger and record for another 25 seconds.
06:02
However, below that you can see that the
06:04
clip will end early if the motion stops.<br>
06:06
As I scroll down, you can see other settings, Infrared
06:09
Illuminator, video quality, if the camera is enabled, latest
06:13
update, the Wi-Fi signal to the camera, and the camera to the
06:17
sync module, which is located next to the wireless router.
06:20
Let's go back a screen.<br>
06:21
With this particular system, this top view is an
06:24
image of what I'm looking at, not a live view.
06:27
Since these run on battery, they are not always
06:29
recording video, only on motion or if I tap the
06:32
video camera icon over here on the left.
06:35
When I do, it takes me to a live video stream of the camera.
06:38
You can see that it's at night and I have
06:40
a skeleton riding a bike next to my house.<br>
6. Summary
06:42
OK, that's it for this demo.
06:44
In this demonstration, we talked about smart devices.
06:47
We looked at few common smart home devices.
06:49
First, we looked at the Amazon Echo, then we looked at
06:52
a smart plug and how that is able to work with the Echo.
06:55
We ended with a quick overview
06:57
of a home security camera system.<br>
