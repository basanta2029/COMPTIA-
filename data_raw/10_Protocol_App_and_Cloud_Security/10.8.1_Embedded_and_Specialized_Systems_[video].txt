1. Embedded and Specialized Systems
00:04
Today's smart technology is being embedded into
00:07
devices like TVs, kitchen appliances, environmental
00:10
controls, and even industrial equipment.
00:12
And it's becoming increasingly common.
00:15
These devices are sometimes referred to as static
00:18
environments because they weren't designed to be customized
00:21
or modified in any way by you, the network administrator.<br>
2. SCADA
00:25
Smart tech history is connected with supervisory
00:28
control and data acquisition systems.
00:31
We just call them SCADA.
00:32
This infrastructure manages automated factory equipment that
00:36
relies on the smart technology embedded in modern devices.<br>
00:41
As its name suggests, SCADA systems provide two general
00:44
functions: supervisory control and data acquisition.
00:49
The first controls remote equipment
00:50
over a network connection.
00:52
The second gathers information from those remote
00:55
devices, allowing you to monitor their status.<br>
00:58
Using network connectivity, SCADA
01:01
systems can manage industrial equipment a
01:03
long distance away from a control center.
01:06
This is sometimes called a
01:07
distributed control system, or DCS.
01:11
To make this work, SCADA systems
01:13
have several different components.
01:15
First, there's a central supervisory computer
01:18
that communicates with and sends control
01:20
commands out to connected SCADA devices.
01:23
The devices have remote terminal units, or RTUs.
01:25
The RTUs connect the equipment to the network, which
01:30
enables them to receive commands from the supervisory
01:32
system and then send status information back.<br>
01:36
Alternatively, SCADA equipment might have
01:39
programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, installed.
01:41
PLCs connect the SCADA equipment
01:46
to the network just like RTUs.
01:48
The difference is that they're usually less expensive.<br>
01:51
Another important component is the type of network link used
01:55
to connect the supervisory computer to the RTUs or PLCs.
02:00
Some of the most common options include a standard
02:02
internet connection, a satellite link, a private WAN link,
02:06
or even a simple modem connection over a telephone line.<br>
3. IoT
02:10
When talking about smart technology and SCADA,
02:13
we can't forget the Internet of Things, or IoT.<br>
02:16
IoT is a natural extension of SCADA.
02:19
Its evolution is such that late-generation SCADA
02:22
systems developed into first-generation IoT systems.
02:26
An IoT ecosystem is made up of web-enabled smart
02:30
devices that use embedded processors, sensors,
02:33
and communication hardware to collect, send, and
02:36
act on data they gather from their environments.<br>
02:40
One important aspect of newer IoT devices is the
02:43
operating system they use because these offer
02:46
connectivity, usability, and interoperability.<br>
02:50
One of these operating systems is called RIOT OS.
02:54
It requires few resources and is very energy efficient.
02:58
It's used on embedded systems, actuator boards, and sensors.<br>
4. IoT
03:02
Another is ARM Mbed OS.
03:05
This OS is primarily used with low-power
03:08
technology such as wearable devices.
03:10
In other words, any mobile device that's
03:13
meant to be worn somewhere on the body.
03:15
These<br>
03:16
devices can be as simple as a step-tracking
03:18
wristband or as complex as a virtual reality headset.
03:22
Most wearable devices are designed
03:24
to interface with another device.<br>
03:27
For example, a smartwatch by itself
03:29
has a limited set of functions.
03:31
But when you connect it to a smartphone through
03:34
Bluetooth, you get added functionality like text
03:37
messaging or being able to answer phone calls.<br>
5. IoT
03:40
Back to the operating systems now.
03:43
RealSense OS X is used in Intel's depth-sensing
03:46
technology for cameras and sensors.
03:49
Then there's Nucleus and Integrity RTOS, which are both used
03:53
for aerospace, industrial, automotive, and medical devices.
03:57
When it comes to drones and robots, Ubuntu
03:59
Core or Snappy are usually preferred.<br>
6. Mobile Devices
04:02
Whether it's a tablet, smartphone, or an e-reader,
04:05
all mobile devices share some characteristics.
04:08
The most common is the power source.
04:11
The power source is typically a lithium
04:13
ion battery rated in milliamp hours.
04:16
The larger the number, the greater the battery capacity.
04:19
For example, the average smartphone battery
04:21
is about 2,000 milliamp hours while a notebook
04:24
battery is about 6,000 milliamp hours.<br>
04:27
Another characteristic is a mobile device's storage.<br>
04:31
To extend battery life, mobile devices use some sort
04:34
of non-volatile flash memory to store information.
04:37
Because no moving parts need to be powered, flash
04:40
memory is a more energy-efficient storage medium.
04:43
In addition, a lot of mobile devices have
04:45
expandable storage in the form of micro-SD cards.
04:49
This allows mobile devices to increase
04:51
their storage to upwards of 200 gigabytes.<br>
04:54
Mobile devices need connectivity to the
04:57
internet and to other mobile devices.
04:59
To do this, they use a variety
05:01
of wireless connection mediums.
05:03
For example, the typical smartphone utilizes 802.11,
05:08
Bluetooth, and cellular wireless technologies.<br>
05:12
Mobile devices also have internal sensors that
05:14
collect environmental data, usually with a GPS chip.
05:18
They use these chips to calculate the device's
05:20
location information, which you can use for navigation
05:24
and for finding your device if you happen to lose it.<br>
05:27
Another internal sensor is called an accelerometer.
05:30
This is a sensor that detects movement on a
05:32
single plane, typically the horizontal plane.
05:35
It detects when a mobile device is turned sideways and
05:38
tells the device to change the screen's orientation.<br>
05:42
A third sensor is a gyroscope.
05:43
It also detects movement, but instead of
05:46
detecting movement on a single plane, it
05:48
detects horizontal and vertical movements.
05:51
If you've ever played a game on a smartphone or tablet that
05:54
requires you to tilt the device, you've used a gyroscope.<br>
7. Smart Devices
05:58
A key issue with smart technology is that there's
06:01
little to no ability to modify the technology within.
06:04
As a result, it's very difficult to manage security.
06:08
For example, you can't install anti-malware software on
06:11
a smart refrigerator or on an HVAC system even though
06:14
there are significant security risks associated with them. <br>
06:18
For example, in early 2014 the first
06:20
documented IoT attack occurred.
06:23
This attack leveraged smart devices to conduct a
06:26
rather pervasive, malicious email-phishing exploit.<br>
06:29
The trouble is that because smart devices are becoming
06:32
more commonplace, we tend to forget about them.
06:35
In addition, smart device vendors are slow to protect
06:38
their products proactively because of cost constraints.
06:42
For this reason, it's even more important for
06:44
you as an administrator to secure your network
06:47
against any possible smart device attacks.<br>
8. Raspberry Pi
06:50
It's also good to keep physical security in mind.
06:53
When an attacker discovers a rogue access
06:55
point, they're able to run various types of
06:57
vulnerability scanners from outside the company.
07:01
But if they gain physical access, they can
07:03
hide a physical rogue access point as well.
07:06
This is often done by configuring an extremely compact
07:09
and powerful hardware device called a Raspberry Pi.<br>
07:12
Just like smart device attacks, a rogue access point
07:15
attack happens simply because a network administrator
07:18
didn't properly configure the legitimate access points.
07:22
Maybe he or she didn't implemented proper
07:24
security measures in the beginning and
07:26
eventually just forgot about them altogether.
07:29
This is known as access point misconfiguration.<br>
9. Defense Against Attacks
07:33
To defend against these attacks,
07:34
there are a few things you can do.
07:37
First, have a solid firewall design in place.
07:39
Second, have intrusion detection.
07:42
Or better yet, install intrusion-protection devices.
07:45
Third, have very strong organizational security
07:48
policies in place so that you're not caught off guard.<br>
10. Summary
07:51
That's it for this lesson.
07:53
In this video, we looked at security risks
07:55
associated with embedded and specialized systems.
07:58
We talked about SCADA, IoT, smart
08:01
devices, and mobile devices.
08:03
We talked about the security risks associated
08:05
with these devices as well as with Raspberry Pi.
08:08
We ended this lesson by talking about how
08:10
you can defend yourself from distributed
08:13
attacks leveled against these smart devices.<br>
