1. Mobile Device Management
00:04
Today, mobile devices are used in
00:06
more workplaces than ever before.
00:08
They create all kinds of new
00:10
possibilitiesâ€”and all kinds of new problems.
00:14
So managing mobile devices is a
00:16
major focus for most organizations.
00:19
Most employees bring a personal mobile device to
00:21
work, usually a cell phone, tablet, or laptop.
00:25
When these personal electronics are used for
00:26
business activity, they're called BYOD devices,
00:30
which stands for bring your own device.
00:33
Before mobile devices were common, every device
00:36
that connected to a network was stationary, such
00:38
as a desktop or printer, so you could add it to a
00:41
domain and manage it with Group Policy settings.
00:45
But it's not that simple anymore.
00:47
Organizations need to manage mobile devices
00:49
and enforce policies to secure their data.
00:52
If an employee copies sensitive data to a device,
00:55
the organization needs to be sure that the data will
00:57
be kept safe outside the organizational network.
01:01
This is where Mobile Device Management policies come in.
01:05
We're going to cover the four main types of mobile
01:07
device management: Mobile Device Management, Mobile
01:11
Application Management, Enterprise Mobility
01:13
Management, and Unified Endpoint Management.
2. Mobile Device Management
01:17
Let's start with Mobile Device Management, or MDM.
01:20
MDM allows IT administrators to remotely manage a mobile
01:25
device, even if it's a personally owned device used for work.
01:28
MDM lets you track the device, push apps and updates,
01:32
manage security, and even remotely wipe the device.
01:36
This solution works well for company-owned devices,
01:39
but the release of the iPhone in 2007 caused a huge
01:42
increase in the number personal devices brought to work
01:45
and used for work-related purposes, such as email.
01:49
Employees didn't want their employers to have
01:51
too much control over their personal devices.
01:54
This is when Mobile Application
01:55
Management solutions were created.
3. Mobile Application Management
01:58
Mobile Application Management, or MAM,
02:00
solutions focus on managing the applications
02:03
on a mobile device, not the device itself.
02:07
Applications that the organization has developed
02:09
or any application that the organization provides
02:12
licenses for falls under MAM policies.
02:16
The organization can put limitations on these
02:18
apps, such as disabling copy and paste functions.
02:22
IT administration can uninstall the app and the data
02:25
related to it in case the device is lost or stolen.
02:30
As more devices were release and their use
02:32
spread, MDM and MAM solutions evolved to keep up
02:36
with changing demands and eventually merged into
02:39
a solution called Enterprise Mobility Management.
4. Enterprise Mobility Management
02:42
One of the main drawbacks of MDM and MAM
02:45
solutions is that there are so many different
02:47
types of devices and operating systems.
02:50
Each device type requires separate
02:52
management tools and systems.
02:54
Enterprise Mobility Management, or
02:56
EMM, solutions solve this problem.
03:00
EMM is a combination of MDM and MAM
03:02
methods into one package solution.
03:05
EMM is hardware-agnostic and can remotely manage
03:09
a mobile device's hardware and applications.
5. Intune
03:12
One of the more popular solutions for Enterprise
03:14
Mobility Management is Microsoft's Intune.
03:17
Intune is a part of the Microsoft Enterprise
03:21
Mobility and Security Suite that's accessed
03:24
through an organization's Azure portal.
03:26
Intune allows IT administrators to manage mobile
03:30
devices and apps, control access to data, and
03:33
ensure that devices comply with security policies.
03:37
Microsoft Intune is included with any
03:39
Enterprise agreement of at least 500 users,
03:42
and it supports all mobile device types.
03:45
I probably don't have to tell you that integrating
03:47
device security with Azure's Active Directory make
03:50
managing mobile devices much, much simpler.
6. Unified Endpoint Management
03:53
Of course, IT administrators need to worry
03:56
about managing everything else that's on their
03:58
network, too: desktop computers, printers,
04:01
Internet of Things devices, and wearables.
04:04
This need was met by the creation of another
04:07
solution called Unified Endpoint Management, or UEM.
04:10
UEM tools provide a single point of
04:14
management for all network devices.
04:16
Essentially, they are a marriage of traditional device
04:19
management and Enterprise Mobile Device Management solutions.
7. Summary
04:23
All right, that's all for this video.
04:25
In this lesson, we looked at mobile device
04:27
management solutions, including Mobile Device
04:30
Management, Mobile Application Management, Enterprise
04:33
Mobility Management, and Unified Endpoint Management.
04:37
We also talked about Microsoft's EMM solution, Intune.
