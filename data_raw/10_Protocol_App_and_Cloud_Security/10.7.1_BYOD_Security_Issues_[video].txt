1. Mobile Device Management
00:04
Let's spend a few minutes talking
00:05
about managing mobile devices.
00:07
When managing a modern computer
00:09
network, you need to take into account
00:10
all of mobile devices that
00:12
will be connected to that network from
00:14
both a management perspective and from
00:16
a security perspective.
00:17
Most users today have more than one
00:19
mobile device that they will use to
00:21
complete their day to day work,
00:22
including smart phones and tablets.
00:24
These devices may be purchased by
00:26
your organization, or they may be
00:28
personal devices brought from home.
00:30
This practice is sometimes referred
00:31
to as bring your own device, or BYOD.
00:34
While these devices allow employees
00:36
to be more productive, they also
00:38
create management issues and open up
00:40
security holes in your network.
00:42
Because these devices are so well
00:43
liked, it really isn't feasible for
00:45
you to try to prevent their usage.
00:48
Instead, you need to formulate
00:50
plans to address them in your
00:51
overall management strategy.
00:52
A key issue to remember is the fact
00:55
that these devices probably contain
00:56
some type of sensitive information.
00:58
The degree of sensitivity depends
01:00
on your organization, the person's
01:02
role, and the information
01:03
downloaded to these devices.
01:05
It is possible that sensitive
01:06
information can leak out of
01:07
your organization through one
01:09
of these mobile devices.
01:10
You need to define processes
01:12
for managing these devices.
01:14
Let's take a look at a few
01:15
things you need to consider.
2. Provisioning Mobile Devices
01:17
First, you should define a process for
01:19
provisioning users with mobile devices.
01:21
Remember, whenever you give an
01:23
employee one of these devices,
01:25
it can open up a security risk.
01:27
You need to carefully
01:28
control who gets these devices and
01:29
what they put on them.
01:31
Begin by defining a procedure for
01:33
provisioning users with mobile devices.
01:35
This ensures that you know
01:37
exactly who has a mobile device
01:38
and what they will use it for.
3. AUP
01:40
Next, you should define
01:42
acceptable uses for these devices.
01:44
There are several key aspects related
01:46
to acceptable use; one is personal use,
01:49
and the other is after normal hours use.
01:52
Employment terms play a factor.
01:54
If an hourly employee is issued a
01:55
mobile device, and that employee
01:57
uses the device after normal work
01:59
hours for company purposes, such as
02:01
answering emails or responding to
02:03
requests, then that individual
02:05
could be eligible for overtime pay.
02:08
This issue also relates to
02:09
personal use of the device.
02:11
If an employee uses a company
02:13
owned mobile device after hours
02:14
for anything that's irresponsible,
02:16
illegal, embarrassing, or even
02:18
malicious, your organization may
02:20
have a degree of liability.
02:22
The liability would stem from the fact
02:24
that the organization issued the device
02:26
to the employee and didn't specify
02:28
acceptable personal use guidelines.
02:31
Therefore, you should include provisions
02:32
in your AUP that explicitly defines what
02:35
constitutes acceptable personal use and
02:37
which activities are prohibited.
02:40
If your organization allows personally
02:42
owned devices, then you must address
02:44
the question of who owns company data
02:46
if it gets copied to a user's device.
02:48
Does the organization still own
02:50
it, or does the user own it because
02:52
it's on their personal device?
02:54
To deal with this problem, your AUP
02:56
should define the kind of data that is
02:58
allowed on mobile devices, especially
03:00
if the device is personally owned.
03:02
It should also define the kind of
03:04
data prohibited on mobile devices.
03:07
You can implement information
03:08
classification labels to make it
03:10
clear to the user into which category
03:12
a particular piece of data is sorted.
03:15
In addition, your AUP needs to
03:17
address the threat of insider attacks.
03:20
A malicious internal user
03:22
could use a mobile device to
03:23
conduct an insider attack.
03:25
For example, the user could use the
03:27
built-in camera to take pictures of
03:28
sensitive internal information.
03:30
They could copy sensitive
03:32
data to the device's storage.
03:34
They could use the built-in
03:35
microphone to record conversations.
03:37
They could use the built-in
03:38
video function to record
03:39
proprietary processes, and so on.
03:42
They could then transmit this stolen
03:43
information outside your organization
03:45
without going through your organization's
03:47
network security mechanism using the
03:49
device's mobile broadband connection.
03:52
This would bypass your intrusion
03:53
protection systems, your firewall,
03:55
and any other network security
03:57
mechanisms you may have implemented.
03:59
Essentially, data could be stolen
04:01
and you will have no idea that it's
04:03
been leaked or how it got out.
04:05
Because these devices have Wi-Fi
04:07
or mobile broadband networking
04:09
built-in to them, it is very
04:11
difficult to prevent data leakage.
04:13
If the user can download or capture
04:15
sensitive information to the device,
04:17
there is no technological means to
04:19
prevent data from being transmitted.
04:21
Accordingly, your acceptable use
04:22
policy should specify where and
04:24
when employees can possess mobile
04:26
devices and how they can use them.
04:28
For example, you could prohibit
04:30
mobile devices in the
04:31
high-security areas of your organization.
04:34
You could specify in the AUP that any
04:36
personally owned devices brought on
04:38
site are subject to random searches.
04:41
Once your AUP has been defined, you
04:43
need to develop a management
04:45
plan for managing the mobile devices
04:47
in your network, both company owned
04:49
and personally owned.
04:50
For example, one issue you need to be
04:52
concerned with is malware propagation.
04:55
If a user's tablet or phone is infected
04:57
with malware, the infection can easily
04:59
spread to your organization's network
05:00
when they connect their device to your
05:03
organization's internal network.
05:05
One solution is to implement
05:07
Network Access Control (NAC) so that
05:09
devices can be remediated before
05:11
allowing them on your network.
05:13
The NAC can install the latest
05:14
antimalware software updates to a
05:16
device and then run a scan to
05:18
ensure the device is clean before
05:20
allowing it on your network.
05:21
Alternatively, you could
05:23
implement a guest wireless network
05:25
that's isolated from your
05:26
organization's production network.
05:28
In this configuration, a BYOD
05:30
device connects to the guest network
05:32
to gain Internet access, but is
05:34
quarantined from the rest of your
05:36
organization's production network.
05:37
Using a guest wireless network
05:39
prevents malware on a BYOD device from
05:42
infecting your production systems.
05:44
You also need to consider policies and
05:46
procedures for protecting data that is
05:48
legitimately copied to mobile devices
05:51
within the guidelines set in your AUP.
05:54
Organizations spend a lot of time,
05:55
effort, and money building internal
05:58
security controls to protect their data.
06:00
However, if a user copies
06:01
that information to a mobile
06:03
device, that data is at risk.
06:05
For example, if the user
06:06
loses the device, the data
06:08
on that device may be compromised.
06:10
All the firewalls, content
06:12
filters, and intrusion detection
06:14
systems that you setup on your
06:15
internal network are completely
06:17
ineffective at preventing this.
06:19
If that device doesn't have the
06:21
appropriate security settings,
06:22
anyone who picks up that device will
06:24
be able view the sensitive data.
4. MDM Infrastructure
06:27
To circumvent this risk, consider
06:28
using a mobile device management
06:30
(MDM) infrastructure, such as the
06:32
Windows Intune service.
06:34
You can require all mobile devices,
06:36
even personally owned devices, to be
06:38
enrolled in your MDM infrastructure.
06:41
You can use this
06:42
infrastructure to enforce mobile
06:44
device security policies.
5. Authentication
06:45
For example, using an MDM, you can
06:48
require enrolled devices to use some
06:50
form of authentication, such as a
06:52
PIN or (better yet) a password.
06:55
You don't want just anyone to be
06:56
able to pick up a mobile device
06:58
and begin using it without having
06:59
to authenticate in some way.
07:01
Without a password or a PIN code,
07:03
anyone who finds a lost mobile device
07:05
could immediately access the
07:07
information that has been saved on it.
6. Lockout
07:09
Also consider implementing
07:10
some type of device lockout
07:12
with your MDM infrastructure.
07:14
If a device is left on, but there
07:17
has been no activity for a period
07:18
time, the lockout feature should
07:20
lock the device and require
07:22
authentication to re-access it.
07:24
For example, suppose I'm at the
07:25
airport using my Smartphone.
07:27
I set my phone down to get my
07:28
luggage and I forget and leave
07:29
it in the terminal.
07:31
After a few minutes of inactivity,
07:33
the lockout feature automatically
07:34
locks the device and requires some
07:37
type of authentication to get back in.
7. Encryption
07:40
You can also use the MDM infrastructure
07:42
to enable device encryption.
07:44
Even if I require authentication and
07:46
lockouts on enrolled mobile devices,
07:48
there is still a risk that someone could
07:50
physically open a lost or stolen device,
07:53
remove its storage, and try to read its
07:55
contents from a different system.
07:57
To prevent this, you can
07:58
enable device encryption.
08:00
Without the correct encryption
08:02
key, the contents of the device's
08:04
storage are undecipherable.
08:06
Again, this can help protect
08:07
data on a device if it gets lost.
8. Remote Wipe
08:09
You can also use the MDM infrastructure
08:12
to remotely wipe mobile devices.
08:15
This feature sends out a command
08:17
over the Internet to a lost or
08:18
stolen mobile device that causes the
08:20
contents of the device to be wiped.
08:23
The ability to perform a remote
08:24
wipe is essential if you allow
08:26
sensitive company information to
08:28
be copied to mobile devices.
08:30
If the user loses a device, you
08:32
need to be able to perform a remote
08:33
wipe as quickly as possible.
08:35
You can even use the MDM
08:37
infrastructure to automatically wipe
08:38
data from a device after a certain
08:40
number of failed authentication
08:42
attempts have occurred.
08:43
If someone finds or steals a device
08:45
and then repeatedly tries to guess
08:47
its pin or password, all the data
08:49
will be removed from the device.
9. Employee Reporting Device Lost/Stolen
08:52
Finally, you should implement
08:54
some type of reporting process
08:55
for your mobile devices.
08:57
Identifying a lost or stolen
08:59
device as quickly as possible is
09:01
probably one of the most important
09:03
components in your overall mobile
09:04
device management strategy.
09:06
If a user loses a device, or
09:08
if it's stolen, the loss needs
09:10
to be reported immediately.
09:12
Remember, users will be either hesitant
09:14
or embarrassed to let you know that the
09:16
device that the organization paid for
09:18
and issued to them is now gone.
09:20
They may fear some type of retribution.
09:23
In spite of this, you need to make sure
09:25
they understand that getting the missing
09:27
device wiped clean of sensitive data is
09:29
the organization's primary concern.
09:32
Make sure users understand
09:34
that timing is critical.
09:36
The longer a missing device goes
09:37
unreported, the more time an attacker
09:39
has to defeat its security mechanisms
09:42
and the more likely the sensitive
09:43
data it contains will be exposed.
10. Summary
09:46
So, in this lesson we talked about
09:47
some things you can do to increase
09:49
the overall security of the mobile
09:51
devices used by your organization.
09:53
We talked about implementing a procedure
09:55
for provisioning mobile devices, defining
09:57
an acceptable use statement, and using an
09:59
MDM infrastructure.
10:01
Then we looked at some general
10:02
provisions you can use to protect the
10:04
data on the device, such as using
10:06
authentication, implementing a
10:07
lockout, using remote wipe after
10:09
failed authentication attempts,
10:11
encrypting the device, and instructing
10:12
users to report immediately if a
10:14
device is lost or stolen.
