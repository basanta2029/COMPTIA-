1. Configuring Microsoft Intune Security Policies
00:04
There are a lot of things you can
00:06
do to secure your infrastructure.
00:08
This is thanks to Microsoft's Intune.
00:10
In this demonstration, we'll take some
00:12
steps to secure our environment with Intune.
00:15
We're going to take a look at Intune security
00:17
policies, specifically some nice baselines that we're
00:20
provided with that can really assist us in this manner.
2. Security Baselines
00:23
So, what we do is search All Services
00:26
here and do a search on baselines.
00:29
This brings us to security baselines.
00:31
There are these great Microsoft security
00:33
baselines that we can call on to enact good,
00:36
secure practices inside of our enterprise.
00:39
These baselines include some basic
00:41
security settings that we want to consider.
3. Microsoft Edge Example
00:44
For example, there's a Microsoft Edge baseline here.
00:47
We can go ahead and incorporate this into
00:49
the security posture of our environment.
00:52
Thanks to Profiles, we can link it in.
00:54
So let's go ahead and take a look at that.
00:57
Under Profiles, notice there are no
00:59
profiles set up for this baseline.
01:01
But we can easily change that.
01:03
We'll go in and say this is my Edge profile.
01:09
We could give it a description if we wanted to.
01:12
It's automatically limited to Windows 10 and later.
01:15
As of October 2019, that's Edge version 77 and later.
01:20
So we'll say Next.
01:22
Edge has a lot of settings.
01:24
The defaults are to enable the supported authentication
01:27
schemes and then list which ones those are.
01:30
We can set those.
01:32
There's the Adobe Flash settings,
01:33
extension controls, and the ability to save
01:36
passwords in the software built into Edge.
01:39
We have many security settings.
01:41
Notice they're preset a certain way to give a good
01:44
baseline of security when it comes to the Edge browser.
01:48
Once we manipulate those, we can then set our scope
01:51
tags and indicate where we want to assign them.
01:54
We could go in and set it up for certain groups of users
01:57
that we've defined, or we could always say we want to make
02:00
sure this gets applied to every user and every device.
02:04
The last step is to create this profile.
02:09
So now we have this nice Edge profile based on
02:12
this good Microsoft Edge security baseline that we
02:15
have, and we can deploy this out to our systems.
02:18
Notice we've done that by
02:20
assigning it to all of our devices.
02:22
After the next sync of our clients, as far as their
02:25
Edge settings go, they'll be in compliance with the
02:27
security baseline that we borrowed from Microsoft.
02:30
That's the one that Microsoft made available to us.
4. Summary
02:34
And remember, there were other security
02:35
baselines for you to look at, too.
02:38
There's the Windows 10 security baseline, the
02:40
Defender Advanced Threat Protection baseline,
02:43
and then of course the Microsoft Edge baseline
02:46
that we took a look at in this demonstration.
02:48
Notice that these have versions, too; you're going to
02:51
have situations where you get new additions of them from
02:54
Microsoft, and the version increments at that point.
