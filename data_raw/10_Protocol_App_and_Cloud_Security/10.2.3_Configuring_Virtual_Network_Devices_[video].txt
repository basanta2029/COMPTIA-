1. Configuring Virtual Network Devices
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to take
00:06
a look at how to manage virtual devices.
00:08
There are two types of virtual devices
00:10
that we can easily manage from here.<br>
2. Virtual Switches
00:12
One of them would be virtual switches, and
00:14
I'm using the server version of Hyper-V,
00:17
which is running on a Windows Server 2022.
00:19
It's essentially the same as the client version,
00:22
but all virtualization programs are going to have
00:25
some type of virtual switch management.
00:27
In Hyper-V, we're going to access
00:29
the Virtual Switch Manager.
00:31
The virtual switch should be created
00:33
before you create your virtual machines.
00:35
Now, in Hyper-V, we have different
00:38
types of virtual switches.
00:39
For example, I can create a private switch,
00:42
and I'll just click 'Create Virtual Switch.'
00:45
The private switch allows the virtual machines
00:47
to communicate with each other, and that's it.
00:50
If I wanted to establish an internal network,
00:53
they could communicate with other virtual
00:55
machines, interact among themselves and with the
00:58
host, but they can't access the external network.<br>
01:01
Alternatively, I could set up an external network where
01:04
they can actually use the host's network card directly.
01:07
You can see there's a check mark here for 'Allow
01:10
management operating system to share this network adapter.'
01:13
This means I'm using the same network adapter
01:16
for both the virtual machines and the host.
01:19
In a real server environment, it would be best
01:21
practice to install a couple of network cards,
01:24
allowing the host to use one network card and the
01:26
virtual machines to use the other network card.<br>
3. Enabling VLANs
01:29
I can also enable VLANs on my
01:31
virtual switches if I'm using VLANs.
01:34
I've created a couple of private
01:35
switches here, 'private' and 'private 2.'
01:38
I also have an external switch called 'Internet.'
01:41
I have plenty to work with.
01:42
After setting up your virtual switches, the next
01:45
step is to connect the virtual network cards
01:47
within the virtual machines to the virtual switch.
01:50
We're going to examine the settings in this
01:52
test VM that I have here to see what happens.<br>
01:56
I already have a synthetic network adapter installed in
01:58
this machine, and it's connected to the private network.
02:01
Again, if I'm using VLANs, I can enable VLAN identification.
02:05
Depending on your virtualization system,
02:08
you may have other additional features.<br>
4. Other Features
02:11
For instance, I can enable bandwidth
02:12
management to prevent this virtual machine from
02:15
monopolizing the network card's bandwidth.
02:17
There are also additional features available
02:19
when expanding the network card settings.
02:22
For example, I can configure IPsec offloading,
02:25
allowing the network card to handle some of the
02:28
IPsec work when encryption using IPsec is in use.
02:32
I can specify the details of how it should be handled.
02:35
Furthermore, there are advanced features where I can
02:37
customize the MAC address or enable MAC spoofing, which
02:41
is required for supporting network load balancing.
02:44
I also have DHCP guard to prevent this virtual
02:47
machine from acting as a rogue DHCP server and router
02:51
guard to stop it from becoming a rogue router.
02:54
Additionally, I can designate it as a protected
02:56
network, meaning that if its network is disconnected and
02:59
this machine is part of a high availability solution, it
03:02
would fail over to the other node in that cluster.<br>
03:06
Port mirroring allows me to send a copy of
03:08
network traffic to another machine, which
03:11
can be useful for monitoring purposes.
03:13
For instance, if I'm using a product
03:15
like Network Monitor or Wireshark.
03:18
I can also implement NIC Teaming, allowing me to use
03:21
multiple adapters in the guest operating system and link them
03:24
together for either increased bandwidth or fault tolerance.<br>
5. Summary
03:29
In this demonstration, we examined the
03:30
various options for managing virtual devices.<br>
