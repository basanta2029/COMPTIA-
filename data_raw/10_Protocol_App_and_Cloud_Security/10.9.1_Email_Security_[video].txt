1. Email Security
00:04
Email security is a big issue for IT professionals.
00:07
Spam, viruses, malware, social engineering all
00:10
use email as the vehicle to carry out an attack.
00:13
In addition, a lot of sensitive
00:15
information is sent via email.
2. Email Security Gateway
00:17
In this lesson, we're going to talk about the steps
00:19
you should take to properly secure email
00:21
communications and reduce the risk of email exploits.
00:25
Let's start by looking at a comprehensive email
00:27
security solution called an email security gateway.
00:30
An email security gateway is a security
00:32
solution that monitors emails that are
00:34
sent to or originate from an organization.
00:38
An email security gateway can be
00:39
software-, hardware-, or cloud-based.
00:42
There are even some virtualized email security
00:44
gateways that function on a hypervisor.
00:46
Hardware-based gateways are typically installed
00:50
in a server room and are configured to have all
00:52
email messages routed through the device.
00:54
Software- or cloud-based gateways function in the same
00:57
way by routing email messages through the service.
01:01
Depending on the solution, an email security gateway can
01:04
offer things like spam protection, malware and virus
01:06
scanning, email encryption, and even data loss prevention.
01:10
Let's take a look at some of the features
01:12
that most email security gateways offer.
3. Spam Filtering
01:15
Spam filtering is offered by a lot of gateways.
01:17
As its name suggests, spam filtering is
01:20
to filter out certain types of email.
01:23
The filter will try to filter out unwanted or unsolicited
01:26
emails and prevent them from arriving to the end users.
01:29
Spam filters use various methods in order to identify spam.
01:32
Some services even use lists that are continually
01:35
updated with known spammers and automatically
01:38
block anything from those emails or domains.
01:41
One thing to know about spam filters is that they
01:43
are far from perfect—"they are not a silver bullet.
01:46
In fact, fine-tuning a spam
01:48
filter is a never-ending process.
01:50
Spammers are constantly finding ways to trick spam filters
01:54
in order to get emails through and sometimes legitimate
01:57
emails will be flagged and blocked by the filtering device.
02:00
However, the benefits of using a spam filter
02:03
far outweigh the time it takes to configure one.
4. DLP
02:07
Another feature provided by a lot of email security
02:09
gateways is that of data loss prevention, or DLP.
02:13
Gateways that employ DLP scan all
02:15
outgoing emails for sensitive information.
02:18
Both the message body and attachments are scanned and if
02:21
sensitive information is found, the email will be blocked.
02:24
If desired, a notification can also be
02:26
sent to the sender or system administrator.
02:30
For example, let's say an employee—"either accidently
02:33
or purposely—"sends an email that contains a customer's
02:36
credit card information to a personal email address.
02:40
When the email is sent, it is filtered through the
02:42
email gateway where it is scanned by the DLP feature.
02:45
Because the email contains sensitive information, the
02:48
gateway blocks the email from being sent outside the network.
02:52
The gateway then notifies the employee that their email was
02:54
blocked and that the system administrator has been notified.
02:58
Just like a spam filter, a DLP solution isn't prefect.
03:02
Its success depends entirely on how advanced the scanning
03:05
algorithm is and how well the gateway was configured.
03:08
Because of this, it's important you understand
03:10
how to properly configure DLP on a gateway.
5. Email Encryption
03:13
The next email security gateway
03:15
feature we'll look at is encryption.
03:17
Remember, email sent over the internet isn't very secure.
03:21
Emails can be intercepted by
03:22
someone with the right know how.
03:23
And because email messages aren't encrypted
03:26
by default, they can be easily read.
03:28
To protect against this, you can use email encryption
03:31
as a standalone or as part of an email security gateway.
03:35
As its name suggests, email encryption encrypts
03:38
the entire contents of an email and, in some cases,
03:41
will digitally sign the email with a certificate.
03:44
This certificate is similar to SSL certificates in
03:47
that they provide a form of identity verification.
03:50
Email encryption can be configured in a few different ways.
03:54
One way is to encrypt all email
03:56
communications, regardless of destination.
03:59
Doing this does provide the most protection; however,
04:01
encrypting and decrypting emails requires a lot of resources.
04:05
And if hundreds or even thousands of emails are
04:08
being sent a day, this might not be feasible.
04:11
Another option is to only encrypt emails that
04:13
are being sent outside the internal network.
04:16
With this method, that funny cat video you email
04:18
to Rick in accounting won't be encrypted, but the
04:21
contract document you send to your client will be.
04:24
Now, even if you only encrypt outgoing
04:27
emails, this encryption and decryption
04:29
can still become a resource bottleneck.
04:32
Luckily, some security gateways offer selective encryption.
04:35
With this option, outgoing emails are scanned in
04:38
a similar way that a DLP solution scans emails.
04:42
If sensitive information is found, then
04:43
the email is encrypted before its sent.
04:46
If no sensitive information is found,
04:48
then the email is sent unencrypted.
04:50
Now, this encryption and digital signing can
04:52
be done using several different encryption
04:54
protocols, such as PGP, GPG, or TLS.
04:59
However, the most common and widely accepted protocol
05:02
for email encryption is the S/MIME protocol, which
05:05
stands for Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.
05:09
The important thing to understand about S/MIME is
05:11
that it requires the use of a public key certificate
05:14
in order to encrypt and decrypt email messages.
05:18
This certificate can either be self-signed or
05:20
purchased from a public CA, but it is required.
05:24
Typically, two certificates are used: one for encrypting
05:27
the email and another for digitally signing the email.
05:30
Digitally signing the email ensures that only the intended
05:33
recipient is able to decrypt the email message and also
05:37
verifies that the email originated from a trusted source.
6. Secure POP/IMAP
05:41
In addition to using an email security gateway,
05:43
you can also further secure email communications by
05:46
ensuring you are using the latest email protocols.
05:49
Whether you are using POP or IMAP, make sure
05:51
to use the latest version of the protocol.
05:54
In addition, both of these protocols support
05:56
the use of SSL/TLS in order to create a secure
05:59
tunnel when connecting to an email server.
06:02
One way to do this is to use a Microsoft Exchange server
06:05
and enable secure POP or secure IMAP communication.
7. Summary
06:08
Proper email security is an extremely
06:11
important aspect of network security.
06:13
Emails can be a vehicle for countless attacks and exploits.
06:17
As such, you need to make sure you take the appropriate
06:19
steps in order to properly secure your organizations
06:22
email communications and prevent email-driven attacks.
