1. Virtual Networking Implementations
00:04
One of the benefits of virtualization is the
00:07
fact that the network environment can be
00:10
virtualized, as well as the hardware environment.
00:13
Each virtual machine on a hypervisor can
00:16
be assigned a virtual network adapter.
00:19
The virtual network adapter can be connected to either a
00:21
physical network segment or to a virtual network segment.
00:25
A virtual network segment has all the components
00:28
that you would find on a physical network segment.
00:31
You have the virtual network adapters, you
00:33
have virtual network switches, and so on.<br>
2. How Virtual Bridging Works
00:36
Let's take a look at how a virtual network works.
00:40
Over here we have a typical physical network switch;
00:42
we have traditional user desktops all interconnected
00:46
using the switch and standard UTP cable, but notice
00:50
over here that we also have a hypervisor host.
00:53
This hypervisor host is also connected to
00:55
the physical network switch with a UTP cable
00:58
just like any other physical host would be.
01:01
However, within the hypervisor we
01:03
have four virtual machines running.
01:06
One option for configuring virtual networking for
01:08
these virtual machines is to take their virtual
01:11
network adapters and bridge them logically--not with
01:14
actual physical cables--but logically to the physical
01:17
network interface installed in the hypervisor host,
01:21
which of course is connected to the physical switch.<br>
01:24
By doing this, each of these virtual machines then
01:26
appears on the physical network as if they were a
01:29
physical host, just like the systems over here are.
01:32
The virtual adapter in each one of these virtual machines
01:36
has their own MAC address and their own IP address.
01:39
Therefore, they appear to be just a
01:41
regular host on the physical network.
01:43
This isn't the only option you have
01:45
when networking virtual machines.
01:48
In this example, we've created a
01:49
virtual switch within the hypervisor.
01:52
This is not a physical switch with real ports;
01:55
instead, it's a switch that's running as
01:56
software in the RAM of the hypervisor itself.<br>
02:00
You can actually connect each one of these
02:01
virtual network adapters and each one of these
02:03
virtual machines to this virtual switch.
02:06
We've depicted it here with what appears to be
02:08
drop cables, but they're not really drop cables
02:11
they're just logical electrical connections using
02:13
the hardware, the hypervisor itself, to connect the
02:17
virtual network adapters to this virtual switch.
02:20
By doing this, we've created a virtual network segment.<br>
3. Creating a Sandbox
02:24
Notice that this virtual switch is not connected in any way
02:27
to the physical interface and the hypervisor at this time.
02:31
Therefore, each one of these virtual machines
02:33
can see each other on the virtual network through
02:36
the virtual switch, but they cannot see any of
02:39
these hosts out here on the physical network.
02:41
This is sometimes called a sandbox environment.
02:44
If you wanted to, you could actually connect the hypervisor
02:46
itself to this virtual switch so the hypervisor can interact
02:50
with these virtual machines on the virtual network.
02:53
But it still keeps these virtual machines
02:55
themselves isolated from the physical network
02:57
and this can be a very valuable configuration,
03:00
especially if you're in a testing environment.<br>
03:03
For example, suppose you're about to roll out
03:05
a new patch to all of your physical servers.
03:08
You could set up virtual servers connected to an isolated
03:10
virtual switch within the hypervisor and then test that
03:14
update to see if it's going to break anything before you
03:16
actually roll it out into your production environment.
03:20
You can even create a router within your hypervisor.<br>
4. Using a NAT Router
03:23
In this case, we've set up a net router that connects
03:26
our virtual network segment to the physical switch
03:29
through the physical interface in the hypervisor.
03:31
In this scenario, we've essentially created a
03:33
virtual network segment that goes to the NAT router
03:37
and then out on to your physical network segment.
03:40
In this configuration, all of these internal virtual
03:43
hosts are able to contact these physical hosts out here.
03:46
However, because we're dealing with a NAT router,
03:49
we can't initiate connections in the other direction
03:52
of course, but you can go out in this direction.
03:56
These hosts would be able to get out on the internet,
03:59
for example, and download patches and updates.<br>
5. Virtualizing the Network Infrastructure
04:03
There are a variety of different ways in
04:05
which virtualization could be implemented.
04:08
For example, you could implement virtualize servers.
04:11
However, you could also virtualize desktops,
04:14
using the virtual desktop interface, or VDI.
04:18
There are actually many ways to do this.
04:19
For example, you could create multiple virtual
04:22
desktops on the same local workstation host.
04:26
This is very useful in a situation where
04:28
you're testing an application on multiple
04:30
platforms to make sure that it runs properly.
04:33
Another strategy would be to implement multiple desktops
04:36
on one physical server, and then allow all of your end
04:40
users to access those virtual desktops remotely.<br>
04:43
Essentially, all of your user desktops are provided as
04:47
virtual machines from a limited number of hypervisor hosts.
04:51
This strategy could save you a lot
04:53
of money in your desktop budget.
04:54
You simply purchase a few high-end servers that will
04:57
host the hypervisor and as desktop virtual machines.
05:01
The end users on the other hand will
05:02
require only very low-end workstations.
05:06
In fact, they don't even need a hard drive if you have
05:09
a basic operating system in the firmware of the system.
05:12
These low-end workstations connect remotely to
05:14
the hypervisor server and then run the desktop.
05:17
You can even use virtualization to provide
05:18
offsite virtualized network components.<br>
05:22
For example, you could use virtualization
05:24
to move your entire data center offsite.
05:26
Instead of managing it onsite, it's taken care
05:30
of by a vendor whose physical facility might be
05:33
miles away from your physical location.
05:35
In this scenario, the vendor manages your
05:38
hardware and your software to provide the virtual
05:40
network that's accessed by your end users.
05:43
This can be very useful because it only requires very
05:45
minimal hardware to be maintained at your physical site.<br>
6. Summary
05:50
That's it for this lesson.
05:52
It's important that you're familiar
05:53
with how virtualization works.
05:55
Almost all organizations are moving in that direction
05:59
because of the cost savings associated with virtualization.
06:02
In this lesson, we talked about how virtual bridging works.
06:06
We talked about creating a sandbox with virtual networking.
06:10
We talked about using a NAT router with
06:12
virtual networking, and then we talked about
06:15
virtualizing the network infrastructure.<br>
