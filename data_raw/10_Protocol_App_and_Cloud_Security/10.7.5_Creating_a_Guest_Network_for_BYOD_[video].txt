1. Create a Guest Network for BYOD
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to look at
00:06
creating a bring your own device (BYOD) guest wireless
00:09
network for employees. This can be a very useful if
00:13
you're an enterprise wireless network administrator.
00:15
When employees work for an organization, they
00:18
expect to be able to have internet access for
00:20
their personal wireless devices so they can
00:22
check social media, email, and so on.
00:24
We don't want them to use our standard wireless network
00:27
because that would be insecure. Instead, we can create
00:30
an isolated wireless network that has access to the
00:33
internet but not our internal network.
00:36
We're going to use this particular vendor's
00:38
wireless networking equipment. The way you do it
00:41
with each vendor's wireless equipment will be
00:43
different, but the same general principals apply.
00:46
Also keep in mind that your organization should
00:48
have a policy in place on how they want to
00:51
create their wireless networks.
2. Define a Guest Network for BYOD
00:53
Before we go too far, we could start configuring
00:56
some of the things on a different device.
00:58
For example, we could use our network security
01:00
device to create a VLAN and handle DHCP for us.
01:04
It all depends on how your organization wants
01:06
to configure things and have them managed.
01:09
Let's continue.
01:11
For this vendor's equipment, what we need to do is
01:13
define a guest access service for our BYOD. Then,
01:17
we need to create a guest wireless LAN.
01:20
The first thing we need to do is click Networks.
01:22
We want to choose Create New Network.
01:25
On this page we decide on a name.
01:27
I'll call it BYOD, which stands for bring your own device.
01:31
Now we're going to choose Guest for our network type.
01:34
When we pick Guest, that network will be
01:37
preconfigured with certain rules and
01:38
policies to help protect our other networks.
01:42
Next, we're going to specify that
01:44
this network will be VLAN 50.
01:46
This tags the traffic so that our other
01:48
network equipment knows how to handle it.
01:51
Now we need to specify the IP for the BYOD network.
01:54
I'm going to give it an IP of
01:56
192.168.50.1 with a /24 subnet.
02:01
This can be anything you want, but I like
02:03
to name things to correlate with the VLAN.
02:05
So, in this case I made the
02:07
third octet 50 to match the VLAN.
02:10
You don't have to, it's just something I do
02:12
to help me remember that when I see addresses
02:14
with 50 dot something, it's VLAN 50.
02:17
This is a Class C private IP range and it'll
02:20
give us 254 IP addresses that we can use.
02:24
When I hit Enter, it populated some
02:26
other settings automatically for me.
02:28
I have the gateway, the broadcast IP, total
02:31
IP count, the range, and my subnet mask.
02:35
I'll scroll down a bit and then come
02:36
over here and click on Update DHCP Range.
02:38
This populates a suggested range of addresses that
02:43
I can use for my DHCP and hand out to the guest.
02:46
It put in 50.6 to 50.254, which is fine with me.
02:51
By the way, I do like to leave a few addresses at the
02:54
beginning of my networks for potential static assignments.
02:57
So this worked out well.
02:59
I'll scroll down a bit more and now
03:01
let's look at our DHCP lease time.
03:04
By default, it's set to 86,400 seconds.
03:07
For those of you who don't like math, that's 24 hours.
03:10
Now, I might want to shorten that.
03:12
If this is an office setting, perhaps 10 hours is plenty.
03:16
Just do the math and change the number of
03:18
seconds to satisfy your lease time preference.
03:21
My DHCP Gateway is set to automatic.
03:24
If my Gateway were something different, I could
03:26
change it, but I'm using the default here.
03:28
I also have some various Advanced DHCP Options but
03:32
there's nothing here that we need to configure.
03:34
Just be aware that you do have some additional
03:36
options if your organization happens to need them.
03:40
I'll click on Save here and go to the next step.
3. Create a Guest Wireless for BYOD
03:44
Now that we have our network, we now
03:46
need to create a wireless network.
03:48
To do that, I go to Wireless Networks.
03:51
I have a regular wireless network called CorpNet but
03:54
I don't want this being used for personal devices.
03:57
So I'll create a new one for that.
03:59
I click on Create Wireless Network.
04:02
The first thing is to give it a Name or SSID.
04:05
For that I just name it BYOD to stay consistent.
04:08
I'll leave it Enabled.
04:10
By default it's set to be an Open network This
04:13
is probably not a good idea since the traffic
04:15
won't be encrypted and others on that network
04:18
could easily have their traffic captured.
04:20
I'll change this to WPA Personal and put in a
04:23
security key here that my BYOD guest will use.
04:27
I'll check Guest Policy.
04:29
This will enable extra security options such as dropping
04:32
broadcast traffic from users' wireless connections.
04:35
It's recommended that you check this.
04:40
Down here I said that we were using VLAN 50.
04:43
This is where we put that in.
04:50
I'm not going to change any of the other settings.
04:54
We have Rate and Beacon Controls, MAC Filtering,
04:57
and we can configure RADIUS MAC Authentication.
05:02
Once again, we won't configure any of this.
05:04
I'll click on Save.
05:07
So here you can see I have my BYOD wireless
05:10
network in addition to my other wireless network.
4. Guest Control
05:13
Now let's look at Guest Control.
05:16
I'll click on it and here I can see our settings.
05:19
First thing is to check the box to Enable Guest Portal.
05:22
Here I can decide what sort of
05:24
authentication I might want to use.
05:26
It's set to No authentication.
05:28
I'll leave it set to the default.
05:31
I can choose how long someone
05:32
has access before it times out.
05:34
8 hours is set by default but
05:36
I can change that if I want to.
05:39
We can use the default landing page our BYOD
05:42
guest will go to or have it redirected for them.
05:45
We have other settings such as creating a welcome message
05:48
or displaying Terms of Service for those using our network.
05:52
We can customize the portal.
05:53
This is what the BYOD guest sees when they connect.
05:57
I can preview what the mobile users see as well, such
06:00
as what they see on a notebook or desktop system.
06:02
I can create a custom background image or custom logo
06:06
and upload them instead of the default ones provided.
06:09
I have all sorts of things I can
06:10
change, like text, color, and so on.
06:14
For Access Control, I can decide what users have access
06:17
to as soon as they connect as well as after they connect.
06:21
I currently have three default networks that
06:23
they're not able to access from the Guest network.
06:26
I can add other networks if needed,
06:28
or actually allow them access.
06:31
I won't make any changes to this.
06:33
I'll click on Apply Changes.
5. User Groups
06:35
The last thing I want to look at is User Groups.
06:38
I'll start by clicking on Create New User Group.
06:42
For name I'll put in BYOD.
06:45
Now what we're doing here is limiting our users
06:47
to the amount of bandwidth they're allowed to use.
06:50
I'm sure you've been to public places and done a
06:53
speed test only to find that the speed is horrible.
06:56
Well, this is where the person responsible does this to you.
06:59
Being greedy with my bandwidth, I'm only going
07:02
to give my BYOD guests 5 Mbps for download.
07:06
For upload I'm only going to give them 2 Mbps.
07:08
I'll click save and you can see the results.
07:12
By the way, the default is unlimited bandwidth.
07:15
That's whatever the max is.
6. Summary
07:17
That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we
07:20
created a guest wireless network where users who
07:22
bring their own devices can connect to the internet.
