1. Mobile Application Security
00:04
Let's look at mobile device application security.<br>
00:06
You need to be aware of several key security
00:09
issues related to mobile device apps.
00:11
These issues include making sure that the apps
00:13
haven't been tampered with, that they don't
00:15
contain malware, and that they're not sending
00:17
information to other parties without approval.<br>
00:20
The first issue we're going to
00:21
look at is application control.
00:24
Let's start by looking at iOS devices.<br>
2. iOS Devices
00:26
All apps on iOS devices come from Apple's app store.
00:30
The Apple app store uses several
00:31
different mechanisms to secure those apps.
00:34
One mechanism is sandboxing.
00:35
A sandboxed app cannot access data stored
00:38
by other apps running on the device.
00:41
They cannot access system files or system resources.<br>
00:44
In addition, all iOS apps are digitally
00:47
signed by Apple or a third-party developer.
00:50
The digital signature uses an Apple-issued
00:52
certificate and ensures that the apps from
00:54
the app store haven't been tampered with.
00:56
App developers can use encryption
00:58
APIs to protect their app's data.
01:00
Developers can use symmetric encryption,
01:02
generated using AES, RC4, or Triple DES.<br>
3. Windows RT Devices
01:06
For Windows mobile devices, all
01:08
apps come from the Windows store.
01:10
Like iOS apps, Windows Store apps are
01:12
digitally signed by Microsoft before they
01:15
can be loaded on Windows mobile devices.
01:17
Again, this ensures that the apps from the
01:19
Windows store haven't been tampered with.<br>
01:22
All apps available through the Windows store use the
01:24
Windows RTAPI, which contains significant security
01:28
enhancements, such as anti-buffer overflow memory
01:30
restrictions, data execution prevention (DEP), address
01:34
space layout randomization, Safe Structured Exception
01:39
Handling (SafeSEH), and sacrificial canary values.<br>
4. Android Devices
01:42
The Android operating system is based on the Linux
01:45
kernel and is released through open source licenses.<br>
01:48
Some Android stores implement good security
01:50
and tightly control their apps, much like
01:52
the App store and the Windows store do.
01:55
However, other Android app stores do not.
01:57
If your users have devices with the Android operating
02:00
system, it is strongly recommended that you require them to
02:03
use apps that come from a reputable source, such as Google
02:06
Play Store, Amazon App Store for Android, and Samsung Apps.<br>
5. Jailbreaking and Sideloading
02:11
Now, even though Apple, Microsoft, and Android
02:13
control which apps are installed on their devices, it
02:16
is possible to circumvent these protections by either
02:18
jailbreaking the device or sideloading an app.<br>
02:21
Jailbreaking a device is the process of removing
02:24
inherent protections placed by the device manufacturer.
02:28
In the case of an Apple or Android phone, the operating
02:30
system can be jailbroken in order to allow the installation
02:34
of non-Apple store apps or to gain elevated root privileges.<br>
02:38
In addition, Windows and Android phones
02:40
are susceptible to app sideloading.
02:43
With Windows devices, this is when non-Windows
02:45
store apps are installed on the Windows device.
02:48
These apps have not been signed by
02:50
Microsoft and could contain malware.
02:52
With Android devices, you sideload by installing an
02:55
application via an APK that was downloaded from the internet.<br>
6. Authentication and Credential Management
02:59
Authentication and credential management
03:01
are also key issues with mobile devices.<br>
03:03
The average user has to remember usernames and
03:06
passwords for a variety of network resources
03:08
and services, including web-based resources.
03:11
To make life easier, many mobile device operating systems
03:14
implement some type of credential management system that
03:17
automatically stores user names and passwords for the user.<br>
03:21
When a user accesses a password-protected network
03:23
resource or website the first time, credential
03:26
management stores the credentials for that resource.
03:29
When the user accesses that same resource again,
03:32
the credential management software automatically
03:34
supplies the necessary user name and password.
03:37
This allows the user to automatically
03:39
log in to that resource.
03:41
Windows RT has a credential manager.
03:43
iOS also has a similar function that uses
03:46
an encrypted key chain for storing digital
03:48
identities, usernames, and passwords.
03:51
Android devices can use the Google
03:53
ecosystem or a third-party app.<br>
03:56
Using credential management software
03:57
is really convenient for the user.
03:59
From a security standpoint, it presents risks.
04:02
For example, suppose a user has stored credentials
04:05
to a sensitive network resource or website on their
04:08
mobile device, and they lose that device.
04:11
Any individual who finds the device could
04:13
exploit that information to gain unauthorized
04:15
access, especially if the user failed to secure
04:18
the device with a password or pin number.<br>
04:20
Therefore, as a best practice, train your
04:23
users not to store credentials to sensitive
04:25
network resources on their mobile devices.<br>
7. App Whitelisting
04:27
App whitelisting is another mobile device
04:30
application security consideration.
04:32
App whitelisting defines specific apps
04:35
a user can install on a mobile device.<br>
04:37
Windows RT provides a feature called Assigned Access.
04:41
Assigned Access allows you to define a
04:43
list of allowed Windows Store applications.
04:46
The mobile device can only have
04:47
the specified apps installed.
04:49
For example, the mobile device could be a
04:51
point of sales system or an educational device.
04:54
For those purposes, you don't want
04:56
Angry Birds installed on the device.
04:58
Any app that's not found on the
05:00
whitelist is not allowed on the device.<br>
05:03
On iOS and Android devices, you can use a
05:05
Mobile Device Management, MDM, solution to
05:08
define and enforce an application whitelist.
05:11
You can use an MDM solution, such as Windows Intune, to
05:15
provide application whitelisting for Windows RT devices.<br>
8. Geolocation Data
05:18
Another key issue related to mobile
05:20
device apps is geolocation data.
05:22
Geolocation embeds GPS coordinates within
05:25
mobile device files, such as an image or
05:28
video file, created with the device's camera.<br>
05:31
If geolocation is enabled, the device's GPS location at the
05:35
time the file is created is embedded within the device files.
05:39
This includes all pictures taken, such as those on your
05:42
vacation, with co-workers at lunch, or in your cubicle.<br>
05:46
This feature can be useful in some circumstances,
05:48
but it can also create security concerns.
05:51
If these pictures or videos are posted on the
05:53
internet, an attacker can obtain information
05:55
about you that you don't want them to have.<br>
05:58
For example, let's say a user in your organization
06:00
regularly posts images with geolocation embedded to
06:04
a social media site like Facebook.
06:06
A cybercriminal could analyze these images and quickly
06:09
discover information, such as where the user works, who
06:12
they work for, and where the user's cubicle is located.
06:15
A cybercriminal could even derive the user's work
06:18
hours, work projects, and personal work habits,
06:21
such as the restaurant they go to for lunch.<br>
06:24
All of this information can be compiled and used for
06:26
social engineering attacks against the organization.
06:30
Therefore, it is best practice to require that users
06:32
disable the geolocation setting for mobile devices.<br>
