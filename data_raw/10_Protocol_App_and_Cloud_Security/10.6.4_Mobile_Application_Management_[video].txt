1. Intune Mobile Application Management
00:04
All organizations have mobile apps that they like to use.
00:06
Due to the different types of device platforms as
00:09
well at data security and ownership these apps can
00:12
be a challenge to manage.<br>
00:14
Mobile Application Management, or MAM, allows
00:17
the organization to overcome these issues.
00:19
Intune is Microsoft's MAM solution.
00:22
MAM in Intune refers to the assortment of management
00:25
features that lets the system administrator publish,
00:28
push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps.<br>
00:32
Each app in Intune goes through a life cycle.
00:35
This cycle is Add, Deploy, Configure, Protect, and Retire.
00:40
Intune provides a full range of tools to
00:42
help you manage apps during the life cycle.<br>
00:45
Intune allows the organization to develop its
00:47
own app catalog, create its own self-service
00:49
portal, and remotely manage apps.<br>
2. Creating an App Catalog
00:52
There are a lot of apps available
00:54
to perform different tasks.
00:55
But it's important that you only use approved
00:58
apps that your organization has licenses for
01:00
and has tested to work with their systems.<br>
01:03
An app catalog allows the organization to
01:05
define which apps a user can and can't use.
01:08
To put together the catalog, the system administrator often
01:11
shortened to system admin adds the apps to Intune.
01:15
Once added, security policies are
01:17
applied to the apps themselves.
01:18
But security isn't ensured if you use unapproved
01:22
apps to access organizational data and resources.<br>
01:26
When adding apps to the catalog, the system admin
01:28
can assign them to specific users or groups.
01:31
For example, tech support usually doesn't need to use
01:34
the finance app that the accounting department uses.
01:37
So that app wouldn't show up in their catalog.<br>
01:40
One cool feature that was added to Intune
01:42
is the ability to blacklist an app.
01:44
These are apps that absolutely shouldn't be installed
01:47
on a device that's accessing organizational resources.
01:50
If the user has one of these apps installed,
01:52
they'll receive an error message that they're
01:54
unable to access company resources.<br>
3. Self-Service Portal
01:57
In a large organization, it's just not feasible
01:59
for the network administrator often shortened to
02:02
network admin to manually push apps out to all
02:05
the different groups of devices.
02:07
But a company can create a self-service portal using Intune
02:10
that makes the distribution of apps easier for everyone.<br>
02:14
Users can access the portal by using a web link.
02:17
The most efficient way, though, is to have
02:18
them install the Intune company portal app.
02:21
When the user installs the app, they
02:23
log in using their work credentials.
02:25
The app then allows the user to
02:26
access their company's portal.<br>
02:29
When an organization adds an app to Intune, the system
02:31
admin decides if it's mandatory to install or not.
02:35
Intune pushes out mandatory app
02:36
installs to devices within 24 hours.<br>
02:39
Using the portal makes managing apps
02:41
much easier for the system admins.<br>
4. Remotely Manage Apps
02:43
So, there's a lot that goes into
02:45
managing the apps for an organization.
02:47
That's why Intune is so valuable for
02:50
its ease and simplicity.
02:52
With users spread all over the world, knowing that you can
02:55
remotely manage app installs and usage is a great benefit.<br>
02:59
All app types except for the line-of-business
03:01
apps automatically update as needed.
03:04
Remember that line-of-business apps are
03:06
those that someone created internally.
03:08
So, those updates are pushed out
03:10
manually through the company portal.
03:12
Once you load updates to Intune, they
03:14
should update themselves within 24 hours.<br>
03:17
When an employee leaves the organization, the
03:20
system admin needs to ensure that he or she
03:22
takes away all access to company resources and
03:24
removes any company data on the user's devices.
03:27
Intune allows the admin to remotely remove apps and clear
03:31
all data from the device without affecting the device itself.<br>
5. Summary
03:35
That's it for now.
03:36
In this lesson, we covered the basics of Mobile Application
03:39
Management and how you can use Intune to facilitate this.
03:42
We looked at how you can create a
03:44
catalog of the apps that users need.
03:46
Then we covered what a self-service portal is and how
03:49
you can use it to make the management of apps easier.
03:52
Finally, we reviewed how you can use Intune to remotely
03:55
manage apps and even remove apps from user's devices.<br>
