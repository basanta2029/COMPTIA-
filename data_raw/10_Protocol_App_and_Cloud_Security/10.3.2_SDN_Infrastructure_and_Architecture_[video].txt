1. SDN Infrastructure and Architecture
00:04
In this lesson, we're going to take a deeper
00:07
look at software-defined networking, or SDN.
00:09
We'll go over how software-defined
00:11
networking can enhance your infrastructure
00:13
to be more responsive, scalable, and secure.<br>
00:16
In a previous lesson, we looked at how the
00:18
SDN controller can respond to changing network
00:20
conditions and make changes to data flow.
2. SDN Layer Architecture
00:23
Let's take a look at the underlying SDN
00:25
architecture to see how this is done.<br>
00:28
So, we have our controller right here.
00:30
Remember, the controller itself is just a
00:32
software platform that contains other
00:34
applications it's the network's operating system.<br>
00:37
The SDN architecture consists of three layers.
00:40
In the middle, there's the control layer.
00:42
This is where the controller resides.<br>
00:44
Above that is the application layer.
00:46
This is where various applications reside.
00:49
One of these could be an app that creates a
00:51
network map of all the devices in your network.
00:53
Another one could be a load balancer that
00:55
stops and starts VMs as resource use increases.<br>
00:59
The application layer and these various apps
01:02
communicate with the control layer through
01:04
what's called the northbound interface.
01:06
These are sometimes called northbound APIs.<br>
01:09
Below the control layer is the physical layer.
01:12
This is where the physical networking devices reside.
01:15
Even though it's called the physical layer, it's
01:18
also where the virtual networking devices reside.
01:21
The physical layer communicates to the control
01:23
layer through the southbound interface.
01:26
The individual networking devices use southbound APIs
01:30
to communicate with the control plane, and vice versa.<br>
01:33
Understand that this control layer, the
01:35
control plane, removes that control plane
01:37
from the physical networking devices.
01:40
In traditional networks, each of these devices would
01:42
have an integrated control plane located on the device.
01:46
However, SDN removes this from the devices
01:49
and creates a single control plane.<br>
3. Controller Security
01:52
There's one last thing to be aware of
01:53
regarding software-defined networks.
01:55
As with the implementation of any new feature or technology,
01:59
the transition comes with some inherent challenges.<br>
02:01
For example, a centralized controller
02:04
introduces a new target for attackers.
02:06
Imagine a third-party application that uses the northbound
02:09
API to gain complete knowledge of your entire network.
02:12
That could be very dangerous.
02:14
Therefore, it's important to be aware of proper security
02:17
techniques and how these interfaces can be compromised.<br>
4. Summary
02:21
That's it for this lesson.
02:23
In this lesson, we took a deeper look into
02:25
software-defined networking, or networking programmability.
02:28
We also talked about some of the security
02:30
concerns you need to be aware of with SDN.<br>
