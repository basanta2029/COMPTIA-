1. Cloud Services Introduction
00:04
More and more networks are shifting to a decentralized
00:07
resource approach by utilizing various cloud services.
00:09
Because of this, it's important that you
00:11
have a solid understanding of cloud concepts
00:14
and how cloud services impact a network.<br>
00:17
Chances are you've heard about the cloud.
00:18
It's used in almost every conversation
00:20
about networking or the internet.
00:22
But what exactly is the cloud?
00:24
Well, it's actually a lot of different things and
00:27
a lot of them have been around for a while.<br>
00:28
Let's say we have an enterprise network here.
00:31
And within this network, we have several switches, routers,
00:35
some servers, workstations, and a connection to the internet.
2. Traditional Network Model
00:38
Traditionally, each of these workstations would have
00:40
all the necessary applications and hardware components
00:43
in order to carry out daily tasks, and these servers
00:46
would each have a single OS installed and provide a
00:49
specific function, such as a file server or DHCP server.<br>
00:54
However, the cloud changes how a
00:55
traditional network model works.
00:57
For example, let's say these workstations
01:00
need to perform a lot of calculations.
01:02
In a traditional networking model, each of these
01:05
workstations would need the necessary software
01:07
and hardware to match to carry out these tasks.
01:10
That can get expensive.
01:12
What the cloud does is outsource these tasks to other
01:15
machines, which are either located on the same network
01:18
or provided by a third party via the Internet.<br>
3. What is the Cloud?
01:21
In essence, the cloud is computing resources that
01:24
are offered or delivered as a service over a network.
01:27
These computing resources include performing
01:29
calculations or computations, the ability to store
01:32
data, or the ability to network resources together.
01:36
The cloud name itself comes from the
01:37
cloud-shaped symbol used to denote a complex
01:40
infrastructure in system and network diagrams.<br>
01:43
In order for a service to be considered a true
01:46
cloud service, it needs to have five
01:48
characteristics, which have been determined by the
01:50
National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br>
01:53
First, it needs to be an on-demand self-service, meaning
01:57
users must be able to dynamically obtain resources.<br>
02:00
Second, it needs to be provided over a network, typically
02:04
the Internet, and be available on multiple platforms, such
02:07
as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
02:10
This is called broad network access.<br>
02:13
Third, it needs to have resource pooling.
02:16
This means multiple users can use the same resources.
02:19
These resources can be physical or virtual, but they
02:22
need to be able to scale dynamically according to demand.
02:26
For example, if a server suddenly gets a
02:28
thousand connections, it needs the ability
02:30
to provision additional computing power or
02:33
offload clients to different VMs or servers.<br>
02:35
Fourth, the service needs to have rapid elasticity.
02:39
This means the services can seamlessly provision resources
02:42
and scale resource usage back depending on demand.<br>
02:45
And finally, the fifth characteristic is what's
02:48
known as a measured service--that is, resources
02:51
can be controlled and optimized automatically.
02:54
In addition, this also means that the service
02:56
provider can collect information about the service.<br>
4. Cloud Deployment Models
03:00
Now, cloud services can be categorized based on the
03:02
way they are deployed, and there are a few different
03:05
cloud deployment models you should know about.
03:07
The first is a public cloud.<br>
03:09
A public cloud is made available to
03:11
the public by a service provider.
03:13
These services are sometimes free,
03:15
but often use a pay-as-you-go model.<br>
03:17
With a private cloud, the service consists
03:19
of an infrastructure provisioned and
03:21
operated solely for a single organization.
03:24
Private clouds are typically hosted at the organization.
03:27
However, there are some private cloud
03:29
providers that provide remote hosting.<br>
03:32
Sometimes several organizations share infrastructure
03:35
for a specific community with common concerns.
03:38
This is called a community cloud.<br>
03:41
And the final cloud deployment model is a hybrid cloud.
03:44
Hybrid clouds are becoming increasingly common.
03:46
Hybrid clouds are a combination of private,
03:49
community, or public clouds for different
03:51
aspects of the services that are provided.
03:53
For instance, a hybrid cloud service can provide
03:56
special load balancing between different cloud
03:58
types if there is a spike in resource usage.
04:02
Hybrid clouds also use both on-site
04:04
and off-site resource hosting.<br>
04:07
Now that you have an understanding of some of
04:08
the basic concepts of the cloud service model,
04:11
let's take a look at the different types of cloud
04:13
services that are available to organizations.<br>
5. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
04:16
The first cloud service we'll look at is
04:18
called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).<br>
04:22
I want to point out that all cloud services
04:24
end with as a service. This is a quick
04:26
way for you to identify a cloud service.
04:29
They almost all use this initialism model, too.<br>
04:32
Now, Infrastructure as a Service provides an
04:34
organization with infrastructure components that
04:37
is, computer hardware components as a service.
04:40
And these hardware components can be anything from
04:42
networking devices to storage and data processing resources.<br>
04:46
For example, instead of having to install multiple file
04:49
servers with redundant hard drives in your server room,
04:52
you can pay a company for storage space on their servers.
04:55
This eliminates the need to maintain
04:57
and secure local file servers.<br>
04:59
And let's say you need to process large amounts
05:01
of data or compile and test applications.
05:04
Instead of needing the hardware infrastructure on site,
05:07
you can outsource this to an IaaS company, such as AWS.<br>
05:12
Another nice thing about IaaS
05:14
is that it can scale as needed.
05:16
For example, let's say you need
05:17
to add more computing resources.
05:20
Without IaaS, you would have to go out and buy all
05:23
that hardware, set it up, configure it, et cetera.
05:26
However, if you are using IaaS, you just
05:28
tell the cloud company that you need more
05:30
resources, and they are immediately provided.<br>
05:33
One thing to know about using IaaS is that
05:36
it only provides the hardware resources.
05:38
It's still your job to handle all the configuration
05:41
and setup and interface with the cloud infrastructure.<br>
6. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
05:44
The next cloud service is Platform as a Service (PaaS).<br>
05:48
Platform as a Service provides all the underlying resources
05:51
that IaaS provides; however, it goes a step further.
05:55
In addition to the hardware resources, PaaS
05:57
also provides the configuration, setup, and
06:00
management of the cloud platform.<br>
06:03
For example, it handles installing operating systems,
06:05
connecting virtual networks, and creating an entire
06:08
environment that is ready for you to use immediately.
06:11
One common example of PaaS is for software developers.
06:14
A lot of companies that offer PaaS have packages
06:16
that are specifically designed for developing,
06:19
testing, and deploying software programs.<br>
06:22
Some PaaS cloud service providers also provide additional
06:25
features, such software design systems, software
06:28
development resources, testing, and deployment resources.
06:32
Like IaaS, PaaS provides scalability and flexibility;
06:36
it can grow or shrink with your organization's needs.<br>
7. Software as a Service (SaaS)
06:41
Next is Software as a Service (SaaS).
06:41
Software as a Service is designed for your average end user.
06:47
It provides end users with the applications
06:49
that they need to perform their day-to-day work.<br>
06:52
Instead of installing the applications locally,
06:54
they use a web browser to access programs.
06:57
Some SaaS providers charge a monthly or annual fee.
07:00
But often, with SaaS, you pay for
07:02
only the applications that you need.
07:04
For example, if a user needs a word processing application
07:07
for nine hours a day, that is how much you pay for.
07:10
If another user needs the same application for
07:13
only three hours a month, you pay much less.<br>
07:16
SaaS also allows you to try new
07:18
software before committing to it.
07:20
You can try it out, paying only for the time you use it.
07:23
If you really like it, you can pay for more use.
07:25
If you don't like it, you can look for
07:26
something else without losing much money.<br>
07:29
SaaS comes in two forms, simple
07:31
multi-tenancy and fine-grained multi-tenancy.
07:32
With simple multi-tenancy, each cloud service
07:37
customer has their own dedicated resources
07:40
segregated from other customers' resources.<br>
07:43
Fine-grained multi-tenancy offers the same level of
07:46
segregation as simple multi-tenancy, but all of the resources
07:49
used by all customers are pooled together and shared.
07:53
Your data is segregated, so other customers can't access it.
07:57
However, your computing resources, applications, and
08:00
other cloud resources are shared with other customers.<br>
8. Security as a Service (SECaaS)
08:04
The last cloud service model we'll look
08:05
at is Security as a Service (SECaaS).<br>
08:07
Now, you might be thinking, wait a second, I'm
08:10
a security professional--why would I want to
08:12
outsource my security services to the cloud?
08:15
This isn't what SECaaS does.<br>
08:17
In one way, SECaaS is similar to SaaS it provides
08:21
a subscription model for applications and software.
08:24
However, instead of being used for productivity
08:26
on workstations, the applications and software
08:29
are specific to organizational security.<br>
08:32
For example, you might subscribe to a SECaaS system
08:35
that provides a high-level anti-virus detection
08:38
service that includes continuous anti-virus updates.
08:42
Other services provided by SECaaS include DDoS protection,
08:46
intrusion detection, and authentication services.
08:49
One of the most common SECaaS providers is CloudFlare.<br>
08:53
SECaaS can sometimes be much more cost effective for an
08:57
organization than having to purchase all the necessary
09:00
hardware equipment and personnel to properly protect a
09:04
network from viruses, malware, and instruction.
09:07
However, it is still a necessity to
09:09
have an on-site security professional.<br>
9. Summary
09:12
The cloud is an extremely useful service
09:14
that more and more organizations implement.
09:17
Because of this, it's important that you understand
09:19
the underlying structure of the cloud and what it means
09:21
to your organization's systems and infrastructure.
09:25
In addition, by better understanding the cloud deployment
09:27
models, you can better protect your organization.<br>
