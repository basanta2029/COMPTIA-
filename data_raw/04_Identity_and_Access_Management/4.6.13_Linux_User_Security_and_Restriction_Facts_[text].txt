User Security

When considering user security, keep the following in mind:

Users should be trained to use secure passwords. Secure passwords use numbers and letters and are more than seven characters in length.
Passwords should expire periodically but not too often.
Administrators can limit the resources that the user can access.
User Security Commands

The following table describes Linux commands used to promote user security and restrictions:
