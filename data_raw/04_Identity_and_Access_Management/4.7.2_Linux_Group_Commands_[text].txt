4.7.2 Linux Group Commands

Use the following commands to manage group accounts and group membership:

Command	
Function
groupadd	
Creates a new group. The following options override the settings found in the /etc/login.defs file:

g defines the group ID (GID).
p defines the group password.
- r creates a system group.
groupmod	
Modifies the existing group.
groupdel	Modifies the system account files by deleting all entries that refer to the specified group. The named group must exist. You cannot remove the primary group of any existing user. You must remove the user before you remove the group.
gpasswd	
Changes a group password.

groupname prompts for a new password.
- r removes a group password.
newgrp	Is used to change the current group ID during a login session. If the optional - flag is given, the user's environment will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in. Otherwise, the current environment, including the working directory, remains unchanged. You can use this when working in a directory where all the files must have the same group ownership.
usermod	
Modifies group membership for the user account. Be aware of the following options:

g assigns a user to a primary group.
G assigns a user to a secondary group (or groups). Follow the command with a comma-separated list of groups.
aG assigns a user to a secondary group (or groups) by appending the group to any group the user already belongs to. Follow the command with a comma-separated list of groups.
- G "" removes the user from all secondary group memberships. Do not include a space between the quotes.
groups	Displays the primary and secondary group membership for the specified user account.
