1. Protocol Analyzers
00:04
Protocol analyzers are used to capture data
00:07
packets moving across a network and analyze them.
00:10
In most cases, you'll see these tools as
00:11
software programs that run a computer system, but
00:15
there are hardware analyzers available as well.<br>
00:18
Be aware that protocol analyzers are also called
00:20
packet analyzers, packet sniffers, network
00:23
analyzers, network sniffers, or network scanners.
00:27
These terms all mean roughly the same thing.<br>
00:30
Some of the more common protocol analyzers are
00:33
Wireshark, tcpdump, Cain and Abel, and WinDump.
00:38
In this lesson, I'll go over how these
00:39
analyzers work and what we use them for.<br>
2. How Protocol Analyzers Work
00:42
The most common way to set up a protocol
00:44
analyzer is to install the program on a
00:46
computer that's connected to a network switch.
00:50
This can be a desktop computer, but laptops are
00:52
also useful as they provide greater mobility.<br>
00:56
When we use a protocol analyzer, the computer's network
00:59
interface card, or NIC, must be placed in promiscuous mode.
01:03
Promiscuous mode means that the NIC is able to
01:06
see all packets on the same network segment.
01:09
In non-promiscuous mode, the NIC only receives
01:12
packets that are addressed to its MAC address.<br>
01:15
Once we set up and configure our computer with
01:18
the protocol analyzer, we can begin monitoring
01:20
the packets that run across the network.
01:23
We can usually just sit back and monitor
01:25
the data without much interaction.
01:28
This is known as passive interception.<br>
01:31
Once we actually begin capturing packets, there's
01:33
quite a few things we can do with this data.<br>
3. Uses for Protocol Analyzers
01:35
Depending on what we're trying to accomplish,
01:38
there are different ways we can take advantage
01:39
of the protocol analyzer's features.<br>
01:42
For example, a network administrator may use their protocol
01:45
analyzer to look for specific protocols like SMTP, DNS,
01:48
POP3, or ICMP that have packets running across the network.
01:55
The administrator could even detect an
01:57
employee's unauthorized internet use by
01:59
scanning URLs that they find in these packets.<br>
02:02
The network SecOps team could use their packet
02:05
analyzer during a vulnerability assessment.
02:08
This could reveal open ports or whether
02:10
passwords are being sent in cleartext or not.
02:15
They could also detect any malformed or
02:17
fragmented packets, which would indicate that
02:19
someone is trying to get around the firewall.<br>
02:22
Malicious users can also use a protocol
02:25
analyzer for many of these same purposes.
02:28
They could use it to fingerprint a system, which means
02:31
determining which operating system is running based on how
02:34
the system responds to different types of network traffic.<br>
02:38
Malicious users can also use protocol
02:40
analyzers to perform active interception.
02:43
This is when the user intercepts data in order
02:46
to perform attacks
02:47
or session hijacking.<br>
02:49
MAC flooding is another issue for you to be aware of.
02:53
A bad actor can connect to a switch and, in
02:55
short, overload it with fake MAC addresses.
02:59
MAC flooding essentially turns the switch into a hub
03:03
and allows the hacker to see all passing traffic.<br>
03:06
Most times, though, protocol
03:08
analyzers are used for valid purposes.
03:10
Just be aware that unscrupulous people sometimes
03:13
use them to get around security systems.<br>
03:16
That'll wrap up this lesson.
03:18
In this lesson, we looked at
03:19
protocol analyzers and how they work.
4. Summary
03:22
We also went over protocol analyzers' many uses
03:25
and misuses, and we saw how you can utilize this
03:28
tool for your role in system security.
03:31
Always remember to put the NIC in
03:33
promiscuous mode to properly capture data
03:35
when choosing to use a protocol analyzer.<br>
