1. Performing Port and Ping Scans
00:03
In this demo, we're going to look at Zenmap.
00:05
Zenmap is the GUI equivalent of
00:08
Nmap, which is a command line tool.
00:10
We've downloaded and installed Zenmap for Windows.
00:14
Even though Zenmap has a graphical user interface,
00:16
we still use the familiar commands that Nmap uses.
00:20
Other than that, the interface is quite simple.<br>
2. Identify the Target of Your Scan
00:23
First, you want to identify the target of your scan.
00:26
In this case, it might be 192.168.2.1,
00:30
a specific IP address, or maybe a range
00:33
of IP addresses using CIDR notation.
00:36
It's going to make sure that these first three
00:38
octets stay the same, 192.168.2, then we'll try .1
00:44
and so on all the way up to .255 for the last octet.<br>
3. Types of Scan
00:49
To the right here, you can see what
00:51
type of scan you want to perform.
00:52
Right now, it's listed as an intense scan.
00:55
To start out, I'm going do a lighter scan.
00:58
You can see you have Intense Scan, plus UDP,
01:01
plus all the TCP ports, without the ping, etc.
01:04
You have the ping, the quick scan,
01:07
the quick scan plus, and on and on.
01:09
There's lots of different options here.<br>
01:11
I'm going to start out with just a ping
01:14
scan, which will simply see if the hosts in
01:16
this IP address range respond to a ping.
01:19
To do this, I'll simply select
01:21
that option and then click on Scan.
01:23
This will only take a few seconds to
01:25
complete, as it's a very lightweight scan.
01:28
You'll see here, as it goes on, that we'll start
01:30
to populate the operating systems and the hosts
01:33
associated with those IP addresses to the left.<br>
01:36
In this case, we haven't done a deep scan.
01:39
We don't know the operating systems
01:41
on these hosts or other details yet.
01:43
But we can see all the hosts that are in
01:46
that range that responded to the ping scan.
01:48
Maybe we come down and say, "Hey, this
01:51
IP address is something of interest."
01:53
Then we can go and do an intense
01:54
scan with that specific host.<br>
4. Intense Scan
01:57
Before I do that, let me show you here that there's
02:00
not really a lot we know about this host right now.
02:03
We know its MAC address, its IP address, and whether
02:06
it's currently up, but we don't know anything else.<br>
02:10
You could do this intense scan
02:11
with a full range of IP addresses.
02:13
It'll just take a while.
02:15
In the interest of time, I'll just do an
02:16
intense scan on that single IP address.<br>
02:19
This takes about four or five minutes to
02:22
complete depending on the responsiveness of the
02:24
server, so I'll stop the demo while it runs.
02:27
But you can see that it's starting to discover
02:29
open ports, different TCP ports, and it'll run
02:32
through a variety of different scripts to try
02:34
to discover information about this host.<br>
5. Results
02:37
When all is said and done, we should be able to
02:39
see what type of operating system it is, even
02:42
the version of the operating system, and other
02:44
things that it uses as it discovers open ports.
02:47
It can query those ports and ask certain questions
02:50
in order to receive responses and determine the
02:53
types of services that are running on this machine.
02:56
We'll go ahead and pause now until that script is complete.<br>
02:59
You can see that it's completed the scan.
03:03
Let's look through some of these results first.
03:06
We'll start at the top.
03:07
It scanned for specific ports, and it started
03:10
a service scan and gathered some information.
03:12
It was looking for 20 specific services.
03:15
It took about a minute to do that.
03:18
Then it tried to detect the operating
03:20
system and a variety of other services.
03:22
It looks at the specific ports and tries to
03:25
determine which programs are actually running.
03:27
This server has DNS server.
03:30
It's actually Microsoft's DNS server.
03:32
Because of the types of queries that Nmap puts out, you
03:36
can see the types of services that are actually running.
03:39
We know that it's Microsoft DNS.
03:41
We know Microsoft IIS, the web server, is running
03:44
there, and we know the version of that web server and a
03:47
variety of other services that are currently running.<br>
03:50
Some remote procedure calls on certain ports
03:53
that are open, and a variety of other information
03:56
like the net BIOS names and the server versions.
03:58
We can get quite a bit of detail
04:00
using Nmap and the associated GUI.
04:02
Let's click on 15.
04:06
You can see that we have a summary of information for that.
04:09
It's Windows, and it has the last boot time.
04:12
It was back on May 9th.
04:13
That's several months ago.
04:15
Then we have the versions and other information.
04:18
This is a great tool that you can use to
04:20
quickly gather information about a network.
04:22
It's easy to see why these tools make it so easy
04:26
to attack and hack, or at least understand the
04:29
composition of the machines within a network.<br>
6. Summary
04:32
All right, that's it for this demo--just a quick
04:35
demo of Nmap and the associated Zenmap GUI and how
04:38
you can do ping scans and port scans using this tool.<br>
