1. Reconnaissance
00:04
Reconnaissance, which is also known as Footprinting,
00:06
is the process of gathering information about a
00:09
target before you begin an attack.
00:11
There are two types of reconnaissance, passive and active.
00:15
Passive reconnaissance is gathering information without
00:18
directly interacting with users, and active reconnaissance is
00:21
gathering information through direct interaction with users.
00:25
In this lesson, we'll look at the
00:27
tools associated with both types.<br>
2. Passive Reconnaissance
00:29
Before interacting with a target, a hacker should
00:32
perform passive reconnaissance to gather as much
00:35
information as possible without alerting the anyone.
00:38
Gathering information through packet sniffing,
00:40
eavesdropping, and Open-source intelligence, or
00:43
OSINT, are the more common passive methods.<br>
3. Packet sniffing
00:47
Packet sniffing is capturing data packets
00:49
and analyzing them for useful information.
00:52
If you're in a public place, you can gather
00:54
these data packets and use a tool like Wireshark
00:56
to see if you can find anything useful.
01:00
Because you're not sending any data, you're essentially
01:03
a bystander, so this is a passive reconnaissance method.<br>
01:07
You need to scan for open wireless networks
01:09
before you can start sniffing packets.
01:12
Two common scanning methods are war driving and war flying.<br>
4. War Driving and War Flying
01:16
War driving is driving or walking around with a wireless
01:19
device to look for open vulnerable wireless networks.
01:23
War flying is the doing the same thing using
01:26
a drone or another unmanned aerial vehicle.<br>
5. Eavesdropping
01:29
Eavesdropping is another way you
01:31
can passively gather information.
01:33
It can include listening to employee conversations,
01:36
shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving.
01:39
People often throw out documents with
01:41
sensitive information and don't realize it.
01:43
Holding your nose and sifting through dirty garbage
01:46
doesn't require any special skills or tools.
01:48
It's a really easy way for any hacker
01:50
to get get really valuable information.<br>
6. Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
01:54
Open-source intelligence, or OSINT, is any
01:56
data collected from publicly available sources.
02:00
This includes doing web searches on search engines like
02:03
Google, social media sites such as LinkedIn, and other
02:07
sources to gather personal identifiable information, or PII.<br>
02:12
After a hacker has gained as much information
02:14
as possible using passive reconnaissance,
02:17
they'll move on to active reconnaissance.<br>
7. Active Reconnaissance
02:20
Active reconnaissance is the process of gathering
02:22
information by interacting with the target.
02:25
Because you are directly interacting
02:27
with the target, you can be discovered.<br>
02:30
During this phase, hackers gather additional information
02:33
that they couldn't get with passive reconnaissance.
02:36
This includes network information such as IP
02:40
addresses, sub-domains, and DNS information.
02:43
They'll also gather system information such as
02:45
operating systems, users and passwords, locations
02:49
of servers, and organizational information that
02:51
wasn't gathered during passive reconnaissance.<br>
02:55
Doing all of this reconnaissance provides
02:57
a wealth of knowledge on the target.
02:59
The goal is to understand the target's security,
03:02
narrow focus for potential attacks, identify
03:05
vulnerabilities, and create a network map.<br>
03:09
Sometimes the line between passive and
03:11
active reconnaissance can get blurry.
03:13
Just always remember that and any amount of direct
03:16
interaction means you're using an active method.<br>
8. Reconnaissance Tools
03:20
There's a wealth of tools and resources hackers and
03:22
penetration tester can use to gather all of this information.<br>
9. OSINT Framework
03:27
One of the first tools a security professional
03:30
should use in reconnaissance is the OSINT framework.
03:34
This framework is a collection of resources and
03:36
tools that are separated by common categories to
03:39
easily gather all sorts of online information, making
03:42
the initial reconnaissance process much easier.<br>
10. theHarvester
03:46
theHarvester is a great passive reconnaissance tool
03:48
that can gather lots of information from public sources,
03:51
such as search engines, social media sites, and Shodan.
03:56
There are some options in the program to brute force
03:59
DNS information, which is active reconnaissance.<br>
11. Shodan
04:03
Shodan is a very popular search
04:05
engine for internet-connected devices.
04:08
Users can search for specific
04:10
types of devices and locations.
04:12
You can use this information to see if a target
04:14
has any online devices without proper security
04:17
and gather more information about them.<br>
12. dnsenum
04:19
Dnsenum is a program that finds all DNS
04:23
servers and entries for an organization.
04:26
This helps you find information such as
04:28
usernames, computer names, IP addresses, and more.
04:33
Depending on the settings used, dnsenum
04:36
can be either passive or active.<br>
13. Curl and wget
04:39
Curl and wget are two programs that
04:42
let you download and upload files.
04:44
You can use them in the active reconnaissance
04:46
phase to download an entire website and view
04:49
its code and resources offline.
04:52
Because you're actively interacting with the
04:54
target, these are active reconnaissance tools.<br>
14. Scanless
04:57
Scanless is a really cool tool for port scanning.
05:01
It uses exploitation websites to
05:03
perform port scans on your behalf.
05:06
This means that you can scan your target anonymously.
05:09
Even though you're not directly interacting with the
05:11
target, this's still considered active reconnaissance.<br>
15. Sn1per
05:15
Sn1per is a scanning tool that
05:18
combines many tools into one program.
05:20
You can use Sn1per to find all sorts of information,
05:23
such as DNS, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
05:28
This is definitely an active reconnaissance program.<br>
16. Nessus
05:31
Finally, we have Nessus.
05:32
Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability
05:36
scanner developed by Tenable.
05:38
You can use Nessus to scan your target
05:40
for known vulnerabilities that you can
05:42
exploit to gain access to the target.
05:46
Nessus has many different options available for
05:48
scanning, which allows you to narrow your focus.<br>
05:52
Using these tools allows you to gather all the
05:54
information you could want about a person or organization.
05:57
Network defenders can also use these same tools to discover
06:01
what information is available to others and take necessary
06:04
steps to remove or hide anything that shouldn't be accessed.<br>
17. Summary
06:09
And that wraps up this lesson.
06:11
In this video, we compared passive
06:13
and active reconnaissance techniques.
06:16
Passive means there is no direct interaction with
06:18
users, and active means there is direct interaction.
06:22
We also reviewed some the common tools
06:25
used in the reconnaissance phase.<br>
