1. Use Rainbow Tables
00:02
Nearly every computer system that requires password
00:05
authentication must contain a password database.
00:08
Because the information in databases is vulnerable to theft,
00:10
storing passwords in plain text isn't a very good idea.
00:14
Therefore, passwords are usually
00:16
stored with a cryptographic hash.<br>
00:18
When they want to crack a password, hackers
00:20
often use rainbow tables to speed up the process.
00:23
So, what is a rainbow table, exactly?
00:26
A rainbow table is basically a table of
00:28
passwords and the computed matching hashes.
00:31
The advantage of using rainbow tables is that they save
00:33
computation time compared to typical brute forcing.
00:36
The disadvantage is that rainbow tables
00:38
can take up a lot of storage space.
00:40
Here, we can look at the website called
00:42
RainbowCrack, and you can see that some of these
00:44
are quite large, over half a terabyte in size.<br>
2. Create a Rainbow Table
00:47
In this demo, we're going to generate our own
00:49
rainbow table using the RainbowCrack collection.
00:52
We're going to use Kail Linux and
00:53
RainbowCrack, which comes pre-installed.<br>
00:56
To open the program, we just type 'rtgen', and it starts.
01:01
Down here, we have a couple of examples.
01:03
In the example, the first part is the hashing algorithm.
01:06
Here, they have MD5.
01:09
Next, we need to specify the character set.
01:11
They've specified loweralpha numeric, which
01:14
is the letters A to Z and numbers 0 to 9.
01:16
1 and 7 are the length of the passwords, so they're
01:20
going to be between one and seven characters long.
01:22
The rest of this information is some advanced
01:24
configuration settings that aren't in the
01:26
scope of what we're covering in this demo.
01:28
You can find more information about the
01:29
advanced features on the RainbowCrack website.<br>
01:32
I'm going to go ahead and create our table.
01:34
I'll do that by typing 'rtgen md5' numeric for
01:38
our character set and 1 through 9 for our password
01:41
length along with the rest of the parameters.
01:43
Let's press Enter.
01:44
When I do that, my rainbow table is created.
01:46
Now, if I want to see where this was located, I can
01:50
type in 'cd /usr/share/rainbowcrack' and press Enter.
01:57
From here, I'll type in 'ls', and
01:59
you can see my rainbow table file.<br>
02:01
I'll clear the screen.<br>
02:03
Now we have to sort our rainbow table.
02:05
To do that, I'll type in 'rtsort .'
02:08
and press Enter.
02:09
Each rainbow chain has a start point and an end point.
02:12
The rtsort program sorts the rainbow chains
02:15
by end point to make binary searches possible.
02:17
It's very important that you don't
02:19
interrupt the sorting process.<br>
02:20
All right.
02:21
That's done, and now we're ready
02:23
to crack a hash with our new table.
02:25
I'll clear the screen again.<br>
3. Crack a Hash
02:26
To crack a hash, I'll type in './rcrack .-h'.
02:32
The dot is to specify our rainbow
02:35
tables, and the -h is for hash.
02:37
Now, we need to put in our hash.
02:40
To do this, I'm going to go to
02:42
this website, md5 hash generator.
02:44
I can generate a hash by entering
02:46
'123' and clicking Generate.
02:49
I'll copy this hash, minimize this window, go
02:53
back to my terminal, paste, and press Enter.<br>
02:58
My results pop up very quickly.
03:00
Here, I've found one of one plaintext.
03:02
It only took a fraction of a second to run.
03:04
And down here, I have the hash that I typed in.
03:07
You can see the numbers I used, 123.
03:09
So, we successfully cracked this
03:13
hash with our rainbow table.<br>
4. Summary
03:14
That's it for this demo.
03:16
In this demo, we used the command line version
03:18
of RainbowCrack to create a rainbow table.
03:20
Then we sorted the table and used an online
03:23
hash generator to create a hash that we were
03:25
able to crack with the rainbow table we created.<br>
