1. Password Attacks
00:04
Passwords are oftentimes the main defense against
00:07
unauthorized access to a computer system or
00:09
sensitive data, and attackers have a variety of
00:12
methods they can use to crack users' passwords.
00:16
Some of the more common methods are social
00:17
engineering, brute force attacks, and rainbow attacks.
00:22
In this lesson, I'll go over how these attacks
00:24
work and how you can defend against them.
2. Social Engineering
00:27
Social engineering is the art of manipulating the weakest
00:30
link in network security, which is the human element.
00:34
A skilled attacker can use social engineering to
00:36
learn a user's password through password
00:38
guessing, user manipulation, or shoulder surfing.
3. Password Guessing
00:42
Guessing a user's password can be difficult, but there are
00:45
techniques that an attacker can use to make this simpler.
00:49
The first thing an attacker might do is try default
00:51
logins and common passwords like password123.
00:55
An attacker might also use social media to
00:57
gather personal information such as pet
00:59
names, family, first car, birthday, and more.
01:03
Then the attacker uses this information to answer
01:06
security questions and reset the password itself.
01:09
An attacker might also try to interact with a
01:11
user to trick them into revealing their password.
01:14
For example, they might call the user pretending
01:17
to be a technician with an urgent problem for
01:20
which they need the user's password to resolve.
01:23
Attackers continue to use this method
01:25
because, surprisingly, it's still very easy.
01:28
An attacker might also use social engineering
01:31
to gain physical access to an office building.
01:34
Once inside, they look around for login
01:36
information that users have written down.
01:39
Unfortunately, many users write their login
01:42
information on a sticky pad and put it on
01:44
their monitor or under their mouse pad.
01:47
This makes it fairly easy for an attacker to find.
01:50
Attackers also go dumpster diving to find these
01:52
notes that might've been inadvertently thrown away.
01:56
These people aren't above searching through your
01:58
trash to gain access to your personal information.
02:02
Shoulder surfing is a passive technique
02:04
where the attacker simply watches a user's
02:06
keystrokes as they type in their password.
02:09
This requires access to the user, but it
02:11
can be accomplished with social engineering.
02:13
Your best defense against these kinds
02:16
of password attacks is education.
02:18
You must be trained on how to handle these situations.
02:21
You should know emphatically that no one will ever
02:24
need to ask for your passwords, and that you should
02:27
never carelessly write your login information down.
02:30
With proper user training, attackers have to
02:32
resort to more technical means to crack passwords.
4. Brute Force Attacks:
02:36
A brute force password attack can be
02:38
a very time-consuming proposition.
02:40
The attacker attempts to guess passwords by using a
02:43
cracking tool that submits every possible letter, number,
02:47
and symbol combination in a short amount of time.
02:50
These attacks can be carried out online or offline.
5. Online Brute Force Attacks
02:54
An online brute force attack requires the
02:56
attacker to submit passwords with the same user
02:59
interface while the target is up and running.
03:02
If the attacker targets a website, they keep
03:05
submitting logins to the site interface.
03:08
If the attacker targets a computer, they
03:10
submit the logins to the login screen.
03:13
The best defense against online brute force
03:15
attacks is to implement lockout policies.
03:19
This means that if someone enters an incorrect
03:21
password multiple times in a short period, the
03:24
system locks them out for a certain amount of time.
6. Offline Brute Force Attacks
03:27
An offline brute force attack requires
03:29
the attacker to somehow steal the password
03:31
file and then run their attacks on it.
03:34
This potentially gives the attacker unlimited attempts
03:37
to run their attack, but it's much more difficult to pull
03:40
off because they have to first get that password file.
7. Password Spraying
03:44
Password spraying is another type of brute force attack
03:47
that someone can use to get around lockout policies.
03:51
Instead of attacking one account, the attacker
03:53
submits a password to multiple user accounts.
03:57
If none of those work, the attacker submits
03:59
a different password to multiple accounts.
04:02
Because there's a delay between submitting passwords on each
04:04
account, the lockout policy is essentially circumvented.
8. Dictionary Attacks
04:09
A dictionary attack is yet another
04:11
type of brute force attack.
04:13
In this attack, the hacker compiles a huge list of words
04:17
and phrases that can be used to guess the password.
04:19
Weak and common passwords, such as password123,
04:23
are extremely vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
04:26
Brute force attacks require a lot of
04:28
time and computing power to be effective.
04:31
This is why hackers use programs like John the Ripper,
04:34
hashcat, Medusa, and Cain & Abel to facilitate the process.
9. Password Cracking Defense
04:39
Implementing proper password protocols
04:41
is your best defense in these scenarios.
04:44
A strong password should be at least 8
04:46
characters, but more is always better.
04:49
It should also contain upper and
04:50
lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
04:53
It shouldn't contain common words and phrases.
04:56
The longer and more complex your password is, the
04:59
more time and effort it takes to brute-force it.
05:02
Also, strongly consider using
05:04
passphrases instead of passwords.
10. Rainbow Attacks:
05:07
When you store a plaintext password,
05:09
it's encrypted and generates a hash.
05:12
Rainbow attacks are similar to dictionary
05:14
attacks, but instead of trying to match up words
05:16
and phrases, a rainbow attack uses tables that are
05:19
already filled with word lists and their hashes.
05:23
Rainbow attacks require less computing power and are
05:25
much faster than brute force and dictionary attacks.
05:29
A rainbow table is a table of
05:31
passwords and generated hashes.
05:33
The hacker uses this table to match the
05:36
password's hash instead of the password itself.
05:39
For example, let's say that a user's password
05:41
is TestOut, and this is the generated hash.
05:45
In the hacker's rainbow table, the password
05:47
SecurityPro generates the same hash value.
05:50
This is a hash collision, and the hacker could
05:53
gain access to the system by sending the hash
05:55
value without having the actual password itself.
05:59
The biggest drawback to rainbow tables is their size.
06:02
Since different systems use different hashing algorithms,
06:05
a table needs to be created for each target system.
06:09
The necessary character sets also
06:11
greatly increase the tables' sizes.
06:13
A single table can range from 30 gigabytes to over 300.
11. Salting the Hash
06:18
The best way to defend against rainbow
06:19
attacks is to salt your hashes.
06:22
Salting the hash just means that some random characters
06:25
are added at the beginning or end of the password, which
06:28
ends up generating a completely different hash.
06:31
The login server knows which part of the hash is
06:33
salted, but anyone who intercepts the hash has no idea.
12. Rainbow Attack Programs
06:38
People use programs like rtgen, winrtgen, and
06:39
RainbowCrack to create rainbow tables and tools like
06:45
ophcrack to crack passwords using these tables.
13. Summary
06:49
That'll wrap up this lesson.
06:51
In this lesson, we looked at different
06:53
password attacks you might encounter.
06:55
We first looked at social engineering
06:56
methods, which target the users themselves.
07:00
Then we covered brute force and dictionary attacks.
07:03
These methods are essentially
07:04
attempts at guessing passwords.
07:06
Remember that these methods take quite a
07:08
long time and usually require sophisticated
07:10
computing power and knowledge to pull off.
07:14
Finally, we looked at rainbow attacks.
07:16
These attacks attempt to match password hashes
07:18
instead of having to guess the actual password.
