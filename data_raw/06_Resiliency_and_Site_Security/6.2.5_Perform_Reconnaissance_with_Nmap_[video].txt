1. Perform Reconnaissance with Nmap
00:04
One of the very first things you do as a penetration
00:06
tester or ethical hacker is gather information.
00:08
There are a lot of tools that can help you to do this.
00:11
Most ethical hackers start with
00:12
some very basic command line tools.
00:14
In this demo, we're going to perform some
00:16
reconnaissance using some of these basic tools.
00:19
Our target is a domain set up by the Nmap
00:21
Security Scanner Project and insecure.org.
00:24
They've set up scanme.nmap.org to help
00:27
people learn about Nmap and other tools.
00:30
They authorize students to do scans
00:32
as long as they're done within reason.
00:33
Let's close the web browser.<br>
2. Reconnaissance Steps
00:35
To get started, we're going to go
00:36
through some reconnaissance steps.
00:38
First, I just want to make sure that
00:40
the site is live, so let's ping it.
00:42
I'll just type, 'ping scanme.nmap.org',
00:45
press Enter, and I get a response.
00:47
I'll hit Ctrl+C to stop the ping, and
00:50
I can confirm that the site is live.<br>
00:51
Now let's find the path to our
00:53
target by performing a traceroute.
00:55
On Windows, you do that by typing tracert.
00:58
But we're on our Kali Linux system, so we need to
01:01
type in 'traceroute scanme.nmap.org' and then Enter.
01:06
I get over a dozen hops between me and the target.
01:09
These, down here, aren't responding to the
01:11
request, but my traceroute still continues.
01:13
This is normal behavior.
01:15
Let's clear our screen.<br>
01:17
Now, I'm interested in finding the
01:18
name server information for our target.
01:21
I'm going to type in 'nslookup
01:22
scanme.nmap.org' and press Enter.
01:26
I get the IP addresses for both IP version
01:28
4 and version 6 along with the server names.<br>
01:31
You can perform a whois search
01:33
from the command line in Linux.
01:35
To do that, I'll type in 'whois nmap.org' and press Enter.
01:39
I'll scroll up, and here, I can see all the
01:41
information about nmap that's available from whois.
01:44
I'll clear the screen again.<br>
3. Perform Basic Reconnaissance
01:47
Next, let's see what happens if we try
01:48
to make a connection with the target.
01:51
I know that port 80 is open because
01:53
we were just at the website.
01:54
Let's use Netcat to see if we can make
01:57
a connection to the site on port 80.
01:59
For that, I'll type in 'nc -v
02:01
scanme.nmap.org 80' and press Enter.
02:05
I get a response back, and it looks like I'm connected.
02:08
Typically, if you want to make sure you're connected,
02:10
you can type 'help', and you'll get a response.
02:13
I do get a response.
02:14
Not only that, I get some information about what
02:17
sort of server they're running and even the version.<br>
02:20
Let's try another.
02:21
I'll use my up arrow to get back to our last command.
02:24
I'll change the 80 to a 22 and press Enter.
02:27
I get a connection again and see that
02:29
they're running SSH, and I get the version
02:31
number along with some other information.
02:34
All right, let's move on.
02:35
I have to press Ctrl+C to get out of
02:37
this, and I'll also clear the screen.<br>
4. Perform Basic Reconnaissance with Network Mapper
02:40
You'll get a lot of use out of Nmap as
02:42
a penetration tester and ethical hacker.
02:44
We were just using Netcat to make connections to ports.
02:47
But with 65,535 possible ports, that would take all day.
02:52
We can use Nmap to do a scan to see what ports are open.
02:56
To do a port scan, I'll type, 'nmap
02:58
-sS scanme.nmap.org' and press Enter.
03:04
The -sS parameter scans the 1,000 most common ports.
03:08
I get some results back.
03:09
I know what ports are open.
03:11
I know the state of the port and what service is running.
03:14
Now, if I want to continue working with
03:16
Netcat, I have a list of ports I know are open.<br>
03:20
Earlier, we did a ping to see if the target was alive.
03:23
Let's repeat that now to get the IP address.
03:25
I'll type 'ping scanme.nmap.org' and press Enter.
03:29
I'll press Ctrl+C to stop the ping.
03:31
Now, I want to do a ping sweep to see what other
03:34
IPs might be associated with scanme.nmap.org.
03:38
To do a ping sweep, I'll type in 'nmap
03:41
-sn 45.33.32.1-255' and press Enter.
03:47
Now I can go through this list and see which other
03:50
IPs might be associated with scanme.nmap.org.<br>
5. Summary
03:54
That's it for this demo.
03:55
In this demo, we did some basic reconnaissance.
03:58
First, we used some command line tools
04:00
to find information about our target.
04:02
Then we used Netcat to connect to open ports.
04:05
Finally, we used nmap to perform a
04:07
basic port scan and a ping sweep.<br>
