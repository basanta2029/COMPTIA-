1. Analyzing Network Attacks
00:04
In this lesson, we'll focus on various
00:06
network attack techniques and indicators.
00:08
A network attack is a general category for a number of
00:11
strategies and techniques that threat actors use to either
00:14
disrupt or gain access to systems via a network vector.
00:18
Let's dive in.<br>
2. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks
00:19
We'll begin by discussing distributed
00:21
denial-of-service, or DDoS, Attacks.
00:21
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is anything
00:27
that reduces the availability of a resource.<br>
00:29
It can target physical hardware, like servers and routers,
00:32
or exploit software vulnerabilities to disrupt services.<br>
00:35
Malware-based DoS attacks can even destroy file
00:39
systems or overload hardware components like
00:41
CPU, memory, storage, or network bandwidth.<br>
00:45
DDoS attacks are a specific breed of DoS attacks.
00:49
They're called "distributed" because they're
00:51
launched from multiple sources simultaneously.
00:54
Threat actors compromise machines and use them as handlers
00:57
in a command-and-control network, forming a botnet.
00:59
These botnets are then used to carry out DDoS attacks.<br>
3. Reflected Attacks
01:05
Assembling and managing a botnet large enough
01:08
to overwhelm a network that has effective DDoS
01:10
mitigation measures can be a costly endeavor.
01:14
This has prompted threat actors to devise DDoS techniques
01:16
that increase the effectiveness of each attack.<br>
01:19
In a distributed reflected DoS, or DRDoS, attack, the
01:24
threat actor spoofs the victim's IP address and attempts
01:27
to open connections with multiple third-party servers.
01:30
Those servers direct their SYN/ACK
01:32
responses to the victim host.
01:34
This rapidly consumes the victim's available bandwidth.<br>
01:37
An amplification attack is a type of reflected attack that
01:41
targets weaknesses in specific application protocols to make
01:44
the attack more effective at consuming target bandwidth.
01:47
Amplification attacks exploit protocols that allow the
01:51
attacker to manipulate the request in such a way that the
01:54
target is forced to respond with a large amount of data.
01:57
Recognizing DDoS attacks is
01:59
crucial, but it can be challenging.<br>
02:02
Look for unexplained traffic spikes
02:04
with no legitimate explanation.
02:06
To mitigate these attacks, we often need high-availability
02:09
services like load balancing and cluster services.<br>
02:12
However, DDoS attacks often involve spoofed source
02:16
addresses, making it challenging to stop them at the source.<br>
02:20
Now, let's shift gears to on-path Attacks.<br>
02:21
In on-path attacks, threat actors position
02:25
themselves between two hosts, capturing,
02:28
monitoring, and even modifying their communication.
02:31
This means the hosts might not even
02:33
realize they're being intercepted.<br>
4. DNS Attacks
02:36
Another attack focuses on the domain name system.
02:39
The domain name system, or DNS, resolves requests
02:42
for named hosts and services to IP addresses.
02:45
Name resolution is a critical addressing
02:47
method on the internet and on private networks.
02:50
There are many potential attacks against DNS.<br>
02:53
On the public internet, attackers might use
02:55
typosquatting to confuse victims with malicious sites.<br>
02:59
DNS can also be exploited in DRDoS attacks
03:02
or by hijacking public DNS servers.<br>
5. DNS-Based On-Path Attack
03:05
If threat actors have access to the same network as
03:08
the victim, they can use DNS-based on-path attacks.
03:12
They respond to DNS queries with spoofed replies,
03:15
often in conjunction with denial-of-service
03:17
attacks on the victim's legitimate DNS server.
03:20
In some cases, rogue DHCP servers might be used to
03:23
redirect clients to DNS resolvers controlled by attackers.<br>
6. DNS Client Cache Poisoning
03:27
Another DNS attack vector is DNS client cache poisoning.
03:31
Here, attackers manipulate the HOSTS file, which is a
03:34
text file containing a known name: IP address mapping.
03:38
This cache is checked before DNS resolution is used.
03:41
If this cache is poisoned, it can redirect
03:43
traffic wherever the attacker chooses.
03:45
Think of it as altering road signs to lead people astray.<br>
7. DNS Server Cache Poisoning
03:50
DNS server cache poisoning aims at
03:52
corrupting the DNS server's records.
03:54
Attackers can perform DoS against the server holding
03:57
authorized records and spoof replies to other name servers.
04:01
DNS server cache poisoning can also involve
04:04
making the victim DNS server respond to
04:07
recursive queries with false records.<br>
04:10
DNS can also be misused for command
04:12
and control of remote access Trojans.<br>
04:15
To detect DNS attacks, monitoring DNS event logs is crucial.
04:19
Look out for unusual query types, suspicious IP
04:22
address ranges, or spikes in DNS lookup failures.<br>
8. Wireless Attacks
04:26
Wireless attacks are security
04:28
threats targeting wireless networks.
04:30
Let's look at a few.
04:32
A rogue access point is an unauthorized
04:34
network access point connected to a network.
04:36
It can be set up maliciously or accidentally.
04:39
An evil twin is a rogue access point mimicking a legitimate
04:43
one, often using similar SSID names to deceive users.<br>
04:47
For example, a malicious user sets up an evil twin with
04:50
the same SSID as a coffee shop's Wi-Fi, intercepting
04:54
users' data when they unknowingly connect to it.<br>
9. Wireless Denial-of-Service Attacks
04:57
A wireless denial-of-service attack prevents clients
05:00
from connecting to the legitimate access point.<br>
05:03
This attack disrupts wireless networks by
05:05
interfering with signals or targeting clients.
05:08
Attackers can jam legitimate networks with rogue access
05:11
points or send spoofed frames to disconnect clients.<br>
10. Wireless Replay Attacks
05:15
The final network attack technique we'll look
05:17
at in this lesson is a wireless replay attack.
05:20
A replay attack is an attack where the threat
05:22
actor intercepts some authentication data and
05:25
reuses it to try to reestablish a session.
05:28
A credential replay is an attack that uses a captured
05:31
authentication token to start an unauthorized session without
05:35
having to discover the plaintext password for an account.<br>
11. Summary
05:39
Well, that's it for this lesson.
05:40
In this lesson, we went over
05:42
several network attack strategies.
05:44
First, we looked at various denial-of-service attacks.
05:47
We then reviewed on-path attacks.
05:49
Next, we discussed DNS attacks.
05:52
And we finished the lesson by looking at wireless attacks.
05:55
Being familiar with the variety of ways
05:57
networks can be attacked is one of the
05:58
most critical aspects of cybersecurity.<br>
