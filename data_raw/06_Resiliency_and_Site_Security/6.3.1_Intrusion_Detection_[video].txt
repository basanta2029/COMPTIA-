1. Intrusion Detection
00:04
The first step in defending our network against unauthorized
00:07
access is knowing if someone is attempting to gain access.
00:10
To assist network defenders in this task,
00:12
we can implement network intrusion detection
00:15
or network intrusion prevention systems.
00:18
In this lesson, we'll look at the differences,
00:20
detection methods, and implementation of these systems.<br>
2. Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems
00:24
To better understand the differences between an
00:26
intrusion detection and intrusion prevention
00:28
system, lets take a look at what each of them do.<br>
3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
00:32
An intrusion detection system, or IDS, is used
00:35
to monitor and detect unauthorized access.
00:38
It doesn't try to stop an attack or prevent traffic;
00:41
it just monitors data packets and creates logs.
00:45
An IDS can be either a software
00:46
program or a hardware device.<br>
4. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
00:49
Similar to an IDS is an intrusion prevention system, or IPS.
00:54
Not only does the IPS monitor network traffic,
00:57
it also works to block unauthorized and
00:59
suspicious packets from entering the network.<br>
01:02
No solution is perfect, and that's why we
01:04
should always implement security-in-depth and
01:07
use both detection and prevention systems.
01:10
Even with an IPS, malicious packets may
01:13
still find their way into the network.
01:15
The IDS can serve as a backup and alert us that something
01:18
suspicious may be going on and record it for us.
01:22
This information will be extremely valuable
01:24
after the attack so that we can figure out
01:26
exactly what happened and what the damage is.<br>
01:30
Now that we understand what an IDS and IPS
01:32
are, lets take a look at how they work.<br>
5. Detection Methods
01:35
Both IDS and IPS systems monitor
01:38
data packets for suspicious traffic.
01:40
They do vary slightly in how they accomplish this,
01:43
but both systems use generally the same methods.
01:46
For simplicity's sake we'll talk about the
01:48
IDS systems, but understand that all of this
01:51
can apply to both unless otherwise specified.<br>
01:54
This first and most common method
01:56
is signature-based detection.
01:58
This type of IDS is sometimes called a misuse-detection IDS.
02:02
It attempts to match the known traffic
02:04
patterns of specific network attacks.
02:07
Similar to how viruses have a unique fingerprint
02:09
that antivirus programs use to detect them,
02:12
malicious packets also have a unique fingerprint
02:15
that the IDS can use to identify them with.<br>
02:18
The other detection method is heuristic, or
02:20
behavior-based detection, sometimes referred
02:23
to as statistical anomaly-based detection.
02:26
With this type of detection, you set up a
02:28
baseline of regular network activity and the
02:30
IDS determines if activity is outside the norm.
02:33
The biggest issue with this method is that a larger
02:36
number of false positives are likely to be generated.<br>
02:39
No matter the detection method being used, an IDS
02:42
can either be a host-based or network-based IDS.<br>
6. IDS/IPS Implementation
02:42
A host-based IDS is software installed on the host system.
02:50
Host-based IDSs are better at detecting
02:52
attacks unique to the services and applications
02:55
on that system than network-based IDSs.
02:56
A host-based IDS also monitors local files for suspicious
03:03
activity, which is something a network-based IDS can't do.
03:07
The problem with host-based IDSs is that software
03:09
must be installed on each system you want to protect.
03:13
This can lead to excessive administrative effort.
03:16
Also, if a system is compromised, the log
03:18
reports on that system become unreliable because
03:21
the attacker may have modified the log files.<br>
03:25
The other option is to install
03:26
the IDS on the network itself.
03:28
This is a physical device that
03:30
monitors network traffic in real time.
03:32
We have two options on where to install
03:34
a network IDS: inline or out of band.<br>
7. Out-of-Band
03:38
Because an IDS is a passive device that simply monitors
03:41
packets, they're generally installed as out-of-band devices.
03:45
All this means is that the device is
03:46
installed outside the flow of traffic.
03:49
It's usually connected with a network tap, like a switch,
03:52
which allows it to monitor traffic without being in the way.<br>
8. Inline
03:55
An IPS on the other hand is an active device that's
03:59
usually installed inline, or in the flow of traffic.
04:02
All data goes through the IPS, where it's checked
04:05
out and either allowed to pass through or stopped.<br>
04:08
Regardless of whether the device is inline or out of band,
04:11
it can be installed in front of or behind the firewall.
04:14
Generally, an IDS or IPS should be installed
04:17
behind the firewall as this uses less resources.<br>
9. Summary
04:21
That'll wrap things up for this lesson.
04:23
In this lesson, we looked at intrusion
04:25
detection and intrusion prevention systems.
04:28
The biggest difference between the two is
04:30
that an IDS is a passive monitoring device
04:33
and an IPS is an active prevention device.
04:36
We also looked at the common detection methods
04:39
that both use, which are signature-based detection
04:41
and heuristic, or behavior-based, detection.
04:44
Finally, we looked at how to
04:46
install these devices on a network.
04:49
IDSs should be installed out of
04:50
band and IPSs should be inline.<br>
