Security Pro 8.0

6.0 Resiliency and Site Security

Today's digital and physical environments present a complex array of threats that you must be prepared to recognize and counter. Throughout this module, you will be challenged to think critically about the vulnerabilities that exist both inside and outside the network perimeter, and you'll develop the skills necessary to protect assets from both conventional and emerging risks. From examining how physical intrusions can jeopardize your organization's operations to learning how real-world reconnaissance techniques are used by potential attackers, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of what it means to defend both the infrastructure and the data that drive modern business.

This module encourages you to engage with practical tools and scenarios, including exploring intrusion detection strategies, working with protocol analyzers, and reviewing various attack methodologies. As you advance through the lessons, you'll move from identifying and analyzing threats to mitigating attacks with best practicesâ€”all while considering the interplay between technology, policy, and people. By strengthening your ability to detect and respond to incidents, you'll enhance your value as a proactive member of any IT, cybersecurity, or site security team.
