1. Network Monitoring
00:04
Keeping an eye on the type of traffic that
00:06
flows across your network helps you to better
00:09
understand what's going on in your system.
00:11
If you know your network and constantly monitor it, you
00:14
can catch attackers before they do any significant damage.
00:18
In this lesson, we'll look at some common network
00:20
monitoring tools and how they can be used.<br>
2. Ping
00:24
One of the more common network tests is a connection test.
00:28
The command line utility named
00:29
ping is the easiest way to do this.
00:32
The ping utility sends an ICMP packet from our computer
00:37
to another device on our network and waits for a response.
00:41
If we get a response, the device is connected and active.
00:45
If there's no response, it means the device
00:47
could be offline or something is blocking the
00:49
reply packets, and we need to figure out why.
00:53
Ping is used in pretty much all operating systems.<br>
3. Tracert/Traceroute
00:57
Traceroute is a tool that allows us
00:59
to see the path that a packet takes.
01:01
Every device the packet travels through
01:04
to its destination is known as a hop.
01:07
The traceroute utility helps us determine
01:09
if there's a specific device in our network
01:11
that's down and causing problems for us.
01:15
Traceroute is the command used in Linux
01:17
and tracert is the command for Windows.
01:20
The Linux version defaults to sending UDP
01:23
packets and Windows uses ICMP packets.
01:26
Other than that, these tools do exactly the same thing.<br>
4. Pathping
01:29
Pathping is a Windows command line tool that
01:33
essentially combines the ping and tracert tools.
01:35
The pathping utility sends ICMP packets to
01:40
check connectivity, but it also gives us
01:42
information such as latency and packet loss
01:45
about each and every hop a packet takes.
01:48
We can also use pathping to see if certain
01:50
router connections are dropping packets
01:52
before they reach their desired destination.<br>
5. Netstat
01:55
The netstat command shows us
01:57
all sorts of network statistics.
01:59
When we run this command, we receive a snapshot of our TCP
02:03
connections, which ports they're connected to, the programs
02:07
that are using those connections, and other statistics.
02:10
We can use this information to monitor our
02:12
traffic and make sure that our computer
02:14
isn't connected to places it shouldn't be.<br>
6. Route
02:18
The route command is used in both Linux and
02:20
Windows to show us our routing table and to
02:22
allow us to make manual changes to it.
02:25
Routers use the routing table to
02:27
determine where to send packets.
02:30
If there's an issue with the routing table, the route
02:32
command can help us find it and make the necessary changes.<br>
7. ARP
02:36
The arp command is another command used
02:38
in basically all operating systems.
02:41
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, and its
02:45
purpose is to match IP addresses to MAC addresses.
02:49
The arp command allows us to view and modify
02:51
the ARP table entries on our local computer.
02:54
We can use this information to discover and
02:57
correct any duplicate IP addresses or invalid
03:00
entries that might cause connection issues.<br>
8. Nslookup/Dig
03:03
One of the biggest reasons for connectivity issues is
03:06
an improperly configured Domain Name System, or DNS.
03:10
DNS is what's responsible for matching IP
03:13
addresses to website or computer names.
03:16
If we're running a web server, we absolutely
03:19
need to make sure that our DNS entries are
03:21
correct or no one will be able to connect.
03:23
Even in an internal network, an improperly configured DNS
03:28
can cause devices to be unable to connect to the server.
03:31
We use the nslookup command in Windows or the dig
03:35
command in Linux to view and modify our DNS settings.<br>
9. Ipconfig/Ifconfig
03:40
Another big reason for connectivity issues is
03:42
the IP configuration on the local computer.
03:46
To view current information about our local
03:48
system, we use the ipconfig command in
03:51
Windows and the ifconfig command in Linux.
03:55
These commands show us the current IP address,
03:58
subnet mask, default gateway, and more.
04:02
We can use this information to correct
04:04
DHCP issues or static IP configurations.<br>
10. Hping
04:09
Hping is a security tool that can be used to send
04:12
ICMP packets as well as TCP, UDP, and RAW IP packets.
04:18
Aside from simply checking connectivity, hping is used to
04:21
analyze the target system to gather more information on it.
04:25
The hping command is primarily designed for
04:28
Linux but can be installed on Windows as well.<br>
11. Netcat
04:32
Netcat is an extremely powerful security
04:34
tool that can basically do anything with TCP.
04:37
Netcat is able to open up a TCP connection
04:41
between two devices and send UDP packets between
04:44
them, scan for open ports, and even listen in on
04:47
connections between individual ports.<br>
12. IP Scanners
04:50
IP scanners are tools that allow us to scan
04:53
our entire network in order to find all
04:55
connected devices and their IP addresses.
04:59
Depending on the program, these tools pull up
05:02
basic-to-advanced information such as routes,
05:04
hostnames, operating systems, and more.<br>
13. Nmap
05:08
Nmap is another powerful network monitoring tool.
05:11
Nmap is a command line utility, but there
05:14
is a GUI-based version called Zenmap.
05:17
We can use nmap to scan an entire network or a specific IP
05:21
address to discover all sorts of information like open ports,
05:25
running services, operating system information, and beyond.
05:29
One thing that makes nmap so powerful is that it can
05:33
scan with different protocols on individual networks.<br>
14. Summary
05:37
That'll wrap up this lesson.
05:38
In this video, we covered a variety of tools and
05:41
commands we can use to monitor and manage our network.
05:45
It's important that we know each of these
05:46
tools and how they're used so that we can
05:49
pick the best tool for our situation.<br>
