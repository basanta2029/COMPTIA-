1. Hardening an Operating System
00:04
Let's take a look at some general strategies
00:06
for hardening an operating system.
00:09
Here we are on a domain controller running Windows Server.
00:12
Let's go to Tools and go to Active
00:14
Directory Users and Computers.
00:17
There are a lot of options here for locking things down.
00:20
The default user is the administrative
00:21
user, and that's a very well-known account.
00:24
It's built into the system, so a lot of
00:26
people understand what it is and what it does.<br>
2. Administrator Account
00:29
One thing you might consider doing is renaming
00:31
the account in Properties, or you could create
00:34
a new account for the administrator.
00:36
Be aware that the Administrator account has
00:38
many groups assigned to it, such as domain
00:41
admins, enterprise admins, and schema admins.
00:45
By default, the Domain Admins group grants
00:47
the rights to configure group policies.<br>
00:50
Samantha Carter has been promoted to a junior administrator,
00:53
so we need to elevate her permissions for this new role.
00:56
We can go to Properties, Member Of, and then Add.
01:05
Type 'domain admins' and hit OK.
01:10
Then you can disable the administrative
01:11
account and just use this account, which won't
01:14
be well known to people outside of your system.<br>
3. Disabling Administrator
01:18
If you do disable the administrative account, be
01:20
aware that it's the original admin account, and it's
01:23
the only one that you can't lock with account lockout.
01:26
So be careful about disabling it.
01:28
You don't want to get locked out
01:29
of your system or your server.<br>
4. Change Passwords
01:32
You'll also want to change passwords.
01:34
Windows Server requires you to enter a complex password
01:37
right after you've installed the operating system.
01:39
You'll need to change any default account
01:41
names and passwords and use complex passwords.
01:44
To change your password, you just right-click
01:46
on the account and go to Reset Password.
01:48
That's relatively simple.<br>
5. Built-in Groups
01:53
You'll also notice that there are a lot
01:54
of built-in groups in Active Directory.
01:57
The Users container, on the left, contains all of the
02:00
built-in groups that come on your server by default.
02:03
These groups can help you control what
02:05
users can access and what they can do.
02:07
For example, when you add somebody to the Backup Operators
02:10
group, that user has the power to back up and restore files.<br>
6. Group Policies
02:14
Let's go ahead and go to our Group
02:16
Policy in Group Policy Manager.
02:19
Go to Tools, and then we'll go to Group Policy Management.
02:24
We're going to go to Domain Controllers
02:26
and the Domain Controller default policy.
02:29
Right-click.
02:31
Edit.
02:32
These are all the Group Policies
02:34
that affect our domain controller.
02:37
Over here, under Computer Configuration, we're going to
02:40
go to Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings.<br>
7. Domain Controller Behavior
02:45
You can see settings that you've enabled to
02:47
lock down the domain controller behavior.
02:49
We're going to look under Security Settings.
02:52
We're going to look at Local Policies,
02:53
specifically User Rights Management.
02:56
Under here, on the right-hand side, we're
02:59
going to go to Back Up Files and Directories,
03:01
and you can see that right here.
03:03
This is basically the built-in groups that can
03:06
back up files and do backups in the directories.<br>
03:09
We have administrators, backup
03:11
operators, and server operators.
03:13
We can add users to this group if we want to.
03:17
Let's also go down to Restore Files and Directories.
03:20
Here are the same groups.
03:22
They all have that same access.
03:24
All three of these, administrators, backup
03:26
operators, and server operators, can back
03:29
up and restore files on your system.
03:32
That's something to be aware of.
03:34
If I give someone Backup Operator rights, they'll be
03:37
able to restore and back up any files on the system.<br>
8. Security Options
03:41
On the left side, there are also security options.
03:44
For security options, we don't care who's logged on.
03:47
They affect everyone.
03:49
Scroll down to Interactive Logon.
03:53
Let's do Interactive Logon.
03:55
Don't require Ctrl + Alt + Del right here.
03:59
This option reduces your security posture
04:02
because the malware can take advantage of the
04:04
fact that the Ctrl + Alt + Del box isn't there.<br>
04:07
Having Ctrl + Alt + Del can prevent some malware.
04:10
If this is enabled, it could open
04:12
your system to some problems.
04:13
But you can only set this across the board for every user.
04:17
You can't define which user can do
04:19
this; this setting applies to everyone.
04:22
In this case, we don't want to do this.
04:24
We're going to hit Cancel.
04:25
Notice that it didn't ask us which user or which
04:28
group to apply this to, since it affects everyone.<br>
9. Server Roles
04:32
Other hardening strategies include installing
04:34
only required software on the systems.
04:36
With Windows Server, we have the concept of roles.
04:40
Server Manager is quite a bit different as well.
04:43
Here, we're going to go to Add Roles and Features.
04:46
We can also see Remove Roles and Features.
04:49
It has a wizard to get you started.<br>
04:51
We'll just click through a few.
04:53
This is very different from older versions of Windows
04:55
Server, but you can do role-based or feature-based
04:58
installation, or Remote Desktop Service installation.
05:02
We're just going to do role-based.
05:04
Select the server you want it to be on.
05:06
I'm going to select my server.
05:09
You can see the server roles that you can add.
05:12
If we go on one more, you can see features.<br>
05:16
Windows Server only installs binaries for any
05:19
service that you want to run on the server.
05:22
This helps reduce the attack surface.
05:24
You won't have a bunch of programs open by default.
05:27
You have to go in, enable them, and turn them on.
05:30
One major difference between older servers and newer
05:32
servers is that the security configuration wizard has been
05:35
completely removed, so features are secured by default.<br>
10. Services
05:40
You should use Group Policy Manager or Microsoft Security
05:43
Compliance Manager to control specific security settings.
05:47
We can also go to our services on Server
05:49
Manager by selecting Tools and then Services.<br>
05:53
It's a good practice to disable or turn off at
05:55
least the startup behavior of any services that
05:58
you're not requiring on this particular machine.
06:01
Microsoft will start up services related to the roles
06:04
you've installed, but often, there may be extra services
06:07
that aren't required for the operation of your system.
06:09
You can go through and look at all the
06:11
services that are started automatically.
06:13
For example, there's a service called
06:15
SSDP that we're going to look at.<br>
06:18
SSDP Discovery is a universal plug-and-play
06:21
type of hardware on your system.
06:23
It's universal plug-and-play for network devices.
06:27
At one time, there were some flaws in it,
06:29
and it's automatically disabled by default.
06:31
You'll want to be careful not to
06:33
disable a service that may be critical.
06:35
Always do your research first.<br>
11. Summary
06:38
That's it for this demo.
06:39
In this demo, we discussed some strategies you can
06:41
use to harden your Windows Server operating system.<br>
