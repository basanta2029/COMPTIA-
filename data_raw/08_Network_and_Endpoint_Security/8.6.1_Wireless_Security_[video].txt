1. Wireless Security
00:04
Wireless networking uses radio frequencies to transmit data.
00:07
This means that anyone with a wireless receiver can
00:11
capture data from a network if it's not secured properly.
00:14
In this lesson, we'll go over some common
00:17
configuration problems and different cryptographic
00:20
protocols we can implement to further secure our data.
2. Weak Configurations
00:24
When we set up a new wireless access point, the
00:26
first thing we need to do is properly configure it.
00:29
Many users just plug it in and use the default
00:32
settings, which is extremely dangerous.
00:34
These settings are readily available
00:36
for anyone to look up on the internet.
3. Default Login
00:39
The first setting to change is
00:40
the default login information.
00:42
All access points are shipped with
00:43
a default login, such as admin.
00:46
No other setting matters more than this one because
00:49
if an attacker has our login information, they
00:51
basically have complete control of the whole device.
4. SSID
00:55
The next setting we should change is the network name,
00:58
or SSID, which stands for service set identifier.
01:03
The SSID can be a maximum of 32 bytes in length.
01:08
We want to make sure that our SSID is unique to
01:11
ourselves, but it shouldn't include identifiable
01:14
information such as last name or address.
01:18
By default, the SSID is broadcast, and
01:21
anyone within range can see the network name.
01:24
We can, though, disable this
01:26
right from the start if we choose.
01:28
This might seem like an obvious setting to enable, but it
01:30
doesn't actually provide as much security as you'd think.
01:34
A determined hacker can easily discover hidden
01:36
SSIDs, and beyond that, disabling the SSID can
01:40
cause connection issues for your device.
01:43
You should experiment to see if disabling
01:45
your SSID is the best option for your network.
5. MAC Address Filtering
01:49
You can also configure your wireless
01:51
access point to use MAC address filtering.
01:54
This makes it so only hosts that have certain MAC
01:57
addresses can connect, which helps you control which
02:00
systems are allowed access in the first place.
02:03
MAC address filtering provides a minimal
02:06
level of security at best, though.
02:08
It may discourage a casual attacker,
02:10
but it won't stop a determined one.
02:13
If an attacker is really set on gaining access
02:16
to your wireless network, they can sniff
02:19
packets and see which MAC addresses are being
02:21
used to connect to the wireless access point.
02:24
Then they can use MAC address spoofing to configure
02:27
their system with one of the allowed MAC addresses.
6. Wi-Fi Signal Strength
02:31
You should also monitor your wireless access point antenna
02:34
placement and wireless access point antenna power levels.
02:38
Data emanation is a significant security problem.
02:42
By default, the radio signals used by a
02:44
wireless network broadcast omni-directionally.
02:48
That radio signal travels farther than you realize,
02:50
which makes it possible for an attacker outside of
02:53
your building to access your wireless network.
02:56
You can limit this exposure by manipulating your
02:58
wireless access point antenna placement and your
03:01
wireless access point power levels to reduce the
03:03
amount of data emanation outside of the building.
03:07
Proper access point configuration is
03:09
important to keeping a wireless network safe.
03:12
But the most important security step is
03:14
choosing the correct encryption method.
03:16
Using a weak encryption method like WEP would
03:19
make a network vulnerable to any hacker.
7. Cryptographic Protocols
03:22
When we configure our wireless network, it's important
03:25
that we select the best cryptographic protocols available.
03:29
For most users, the Wi-Fi Protected Access,
03:32
or WPA, versions 2 or 3 are the best options.
8. WPA2
03:35
WPA2 was first introduced in 2004
03:39
and is still widely used today.
03:42
There are two versions
03:43
availableâ€”WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise.
03:43
WPA2-Personal, also known as WPA2-PSK, or WPA2
03:51
pre-shared key, protects our network by using a
03:59
pre-shared key referred to as the passphrase.
04:01
WPA2-Enterprise verifies users through a RADIUS server.
04:06
WPA2-Personal uses AES with CCMP to encrypt all data.
04:13
This stands for Advanced Encryption Standard
04:15
with Counter Mode Cypher Block Chaining
04:18
Message Authentication Code Protocol.
04:20
AES with CCMP uses a 128-bit key
04:25
and encrypts data in 128-bit blocks.
04:29
When a device connects to the access point, a
04:31
four-way handshake occurs to authenticate the device.
04:34
The pre-shared key and SSID are used to
04:37
generate a session key during this process.
04:39
A hacker can take advantage of some vulnerabilities in the
04:43
four-way handshake to intercept the data and perform offline
04:46
password attacks that could eventually crack weak passwords.
9. WPA3
04:50
To address these vulnerabilities and support new
04:52
technologies, the WPA3 standard is being implemented.
04:56
WPA3 was introduced in 2018.
04:59
Instead of using a pre-shared key, WPA3
05:03
uses the Simultaneous Authentication of
05:05
Equals standard, or SAE standard.
05:07
SAE uses a 128-bit key and perfect
05:12
forward secrecy to authenticate.
05:14
Perfect forward secrecy is a cryptographic method
05:17
that generates a new key for every transmission.
05:20
This makes the handshake much more secure
05:22
because if a hacker gets ahold of one message,
05:25
they still aren't able to crack the keys.
05:27
It'll take a while for WPA3 to fully replace WPA2 since
05:32
WPA2 is currently implemented in many network devices.
05:36
Until then, we need to be aware of the differences in
05:39
these standards and their encryption method vulnerabilities
05:42
so that we can better protect our networks.
10. Summary
05:45
That'll wrap up this lesson.
05:46
In this lesson, we looked at some things we
05:48
can do to better secure out wireless networks.
05:51
We first looked at some of the default configurations
05:54
we should change, including login information, the
05:57
SSID, MAC address filtering, and transmission power.
06:01
Then we looked at the two main cryptographic
06:03
protocols in use today, which are WPA2 and WPA3.
06:07
WPA2 is still the most widely used protocol, but
06:12
WPA3 has been released and will eventually fix
06:14
many of the vulnerabilities inherent in WPA2.
