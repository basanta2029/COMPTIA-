1. Version Control Management
00:04
When you develop an application, the most
00:07
valuable possession is the source code.
00:09
Having it protected is critical.
00:11
In this lesson, we'll discuss version control
00:14
management as well as provisioning and deprovisioning,
00:17
which aid in protecting the source code.
00:20
In application development, there's usually a complex
00:23
process of writing, revising, and updating the code since
00:27
multiple developers work together on the same project.
00:30
There are different ways to approach this
00:32
reality as this creates a challenge when
00:35
keeping track of changes in the code.
00:37
In general, most organizations use a version
00:40
control system, or VCS, to track these changes.
2. Version Control System (VCS)
00:45
Let's look at how it works.
00:46
A version control system uses a repository,
00:49
which is a storage location that holds all
00:52
the source files used during development.
00:54
This centralized file system can be
00:57
accessed by all authorized users.
00:59
It allows developers to simultaneously work
01:02
on the same file, revert to older files, and
01:05
even restore files that were deleted.
01:08
These repositories are often stored in
01:10
the cloud or on a third-party website.
3. Version Control System Benefits
01:12
There are many benefits to using a VCS.
01:16
For one, it has the flexibility to
01:19
allow for branching and merging.
01:21
This allows a developer to work on one specific
01:24
feature in a branch that he or she created, and
01:27
then merge it back into the source code when ready.
01:31
It also keeps a history of code changes.
01:33
This history includes the details
01:35
of who, what, when, and why.
01:38
Together with annotations that developers can add, a team
01:42
can understand why the code was designed the way it was.
01:45
This also helps prevent incompatibility issues without
01:49
preventing the developers from continuing their work.
4. Provisioning and Deprovisioning
01:52
Now let's talk about provisioning.
01:54
Provisioning is the process of giving access
01:56
to users through privileges and permissions.
02:00
It's important that developers and others
02:02
working on a project have access to all
02:04
the resources they need to do their work.
02:07
This includes the permissions that you give in
02:10
the VCS as well as in other areas of your system.
02:13
It's important to only give permissions for
02:15
specifically what a user needs and only
02:18
until he or she no longer needs that access.
02:21
If he or she moves on to another project,
02:23
changes roles, leaves the organization, or if the
02:26
project is complete, be sure to deprovision them.
02:30
This means that you remove their privileges and permissions.
02:34
This is the basic idea behind the principle of least
02:37
privilege, which is important in application
02:39
development just as it is throughout your organization.
5. Summary
02:43
That's it for this lesson.
02:45
In this lesson, we discussed important secure
02:47
coding techniques that include using a version
02:50
control system to provide continuity, traceability,
02:53
and protection throughout the development process.
02:56
We then went over provisioning and deprovisioning
02:59
as they apply to protecting the source code.
