1. Operating System Hardening
00:04
The main purpose of hardening an operating system
00:07
is to eliminate as many security risks as possible.
2. Password Security
00:10
If they're not implemented correctly, passwords
00:13
can be an operating system vulnerability.
00:15
To mitigate this issue, passwords should be complex.
00:19
This means that they should be at least 12 characters
00:21
long and include capital letters, numbers, and symbols.
00:24
In a high-security environment, passwords alone are just
00:28
too vulnerable; multi-factor authentication is a must.
00:32
Multi-Factor authentication uses two or more
00:35
authentication factors, such as something you know,
00:38
like a password or a pin; something you have, like a
00:41
smart card; or something you are, like a retina scan.
3. Limit Privilege
00:45
Another hardening technique is to
00:47
limit operating system exposure.
00:49
To do this, you should first ensure that administrative
00:52
privileges are only provided to system administrators.
00:56
Next, system management should ensure that
00:58
users are only given the rights and permissions
01:01
required to do their jobs â€“ nothing more.
01:04
This concept is called the principle of least privilege.
4. Limit Software and Services
01:08
You should also ensure that only the software used by
01:10
administrators and users is installed on your systems.
01:14
Removing unnecessary software reduces the attack surface,
01:18
giving hackers fewer chances to exploit a system.
01:21
For that reason, you should disable
01:23
unnecessary or non-essential services.
01:26
Unused services often aren't configured
01:28
securely or configured at all.
01:30
They're attractive to hackers, and
01:32
sustained attacks can go unnoticed.
01:35
Examples of non-essential services
01:37
are TFTP, Telnet, and SNMP.
01:40
These are all clear text services.
01:43
DNS, ICMP, and NTP are essential protocols and services.
01:48
If your system isn't a DNS server,
01:50
you'll want to disable the DNS service.
01:53
It's good to note that in Windows 10, some of these
01:56
services are disabled by default, such as Telnet and TFTP.
02:00
Systems should also be protected with security
02:03
software, such as antivirus, anti-spyware,
02:04
anti-rootkit, and personal or client firewall software.
02:10
When you use this type of security software,
02:12
ensure that it comes from a trusted publisher
02:15
and doesn't conflict with other programs in use.
5. Baselines
02:19
Another aspect of hardening an operating
02:21
system is to develop system baselines.
02:24
A baseline is a standard applied to systems.
02:27
It defines standards for configuration
02:29
management, security policies, software and
02:32
backup policies, and several other topics.
02:35
Developing standard baselines helps ensure that an
02:37
organization is working at peak efficiency and security base.
02:42
If baselines are appropriately configured and applied, it
02:45
becomes fairly easy to detect systems that may be vulnerable
02:49
since they're operating outside established standards.
02:52
There are several types of baselines to consider.
02:56
A configuration baseline establishes the
02:58
standard configuration for all systems.
03:01
This baseline defines the default system
03:03
configuration, including loaded software,
03:06
enabled services, and domain connectivity.
03:09
Further configuration and changes to the
03:11
configuration can be achieved via Group Policies.
03:15
A security baseline defines the secure computing
03:18
components, such as the security software used to
03:21
protect individual systems, that are installed
03:23
and configured on your workstations.
03:26
Definition updates and changes are all configured
03:29
and ready to go as part of the baseline.
03:31
In addition, any enterprise hardware such as
03:35
firewalls, gateways, and SPAM filters (and their
03:37
configurations) are specified as part of this baseline.
03:41
A software & use baseline defines acceptable
03:44
system use and supported software.
03:47
Software managers can control a
03:49
user's ability to employ software.
03:51
This can also help administrators by keeping track of
03:54
use licenses and, potentially, reduce expenditures by
03:57
limiting the number of purchased software use licenses.
04:01
It also helps define appropriate use policies by defining
04:05
how to implement Group Policies to provide allowed services
04:08
while preventing unauthorized use of disallowed services.
04:12
As a whole, baselines should be reviewed and modified
04:16
to reflect the changes organizations make constantly.
04:19
When new software or new versions of existing
04:22
software are introduced, the baseline must be
04:24
changed to reflect the update.
04:26
If security policies change, such as the frequency
04:29
of password changes or password complexity
04:32
requirements, the baseline must be updated again.
04:35
Baselines are not static.
04:37
They should be thought of as a guideline or practice to
04:40
ensure the efficient and safe use of computer systems.
04:43
Further, they should reduce the attack surface that
04:46
threat actors can exploit to gain access to your system.
6. Patch Management
04:50
The last topic for this lesson is patch management.
04:53
Patch management is the process of
04:55
managing patches for all of your systems.
04:59
A patch management system can provide centralized control.
05:02
A common system is Microsoft's patch management product
05:06
Windows Software Update Service, or WSUS for short.
05:10
Patch management activities include determining
05:13
which patches are needed on your systems,
05:15
applying the patches, and then auditing for the
05:18
successful application of those patches.
05:20
Before patches are applied, a small group of deployments
05:23
is usually tested, especially for service packs.
05:27
If a problem exists with the patch process,
05:29
it's much easier to handle a small deployment
05:32
than to face a system-wide crisis.
05:35
This group is generally comprised of
05:37
power users who know how to fix issues.
05:39
They're given additional permissions and rights so they can
05:42
continue working if something goes wrong with deployment.
05:46
Larger organizations may have a lab that represents the
05:48
types of systems in use by users throughout the enterprise.
05:53
Tests are conducted within the lab and verified
05:56
before they're released to the general user community.
05:59
A best practice is to create a system restore point before
06:03
you patch systems just in case something goes wrong.
06:06
Now, sometimes, a patch is overkill, so
06:09
we also have hot fixes to choose from.
06:12
Hot fixes are quick fixes for problems.
06:15
Usually, you don't install the hot fix unless
06:18
you have the specific problem it's intended for.
06:21
Hot fixes sometimes address a specific customer
06:23
situation and may be distributed only to that customer.
06:28
Hot fixes are also commonly used to
06:30
address freshly discovered security holes.
06:33
A patch could also be a temporary quick fix.
06:36
Generally, a manufacturer tests patches more than a
06:39
hot fix, and patches are designed for wider deployment.
06:43
Patches can include hot fixes that the manufacturers
06:46
have thoroughly tested for mass deployment.
06:49
Patches typically contain fixes for
06:51
security holes and discovered system bugs.
06:54
As an example, Microsoft releases
06:56
security patches once per month.
06:59
Service packs are installable packages that include several
07:03
patches from the same vendor for various applications.
07:06
Service packs usually include patches and hot fixes that
07:09
have been tested by the manufacturer for wide deployment.
07:13
Before fully deploying the service pack, you'll
07:16
usually let a small designated group test it to
07:19
make sure it's fully compatible with your system.
07:21
But if you have a specific issue, you may want
07:24
to install a patch or a hot fix immediately.
7. Summary
07:28
That's it for this lesson.
07:29
In this video, we talked about operating system hardening.
07:32
First, we discussed the importance of using
07:34
secure passwords, limiting administrative
07:37
privileges, installing only needed, secure
07:39
software, and removing non-essential services.
07:43
Next, we discussed the role baselines
07:45
play in keeping our systems secure.
07:47
We ended this lesson by discussing the
07:49
importance of applying the latest patches
07:51
and service packs to your systems.
