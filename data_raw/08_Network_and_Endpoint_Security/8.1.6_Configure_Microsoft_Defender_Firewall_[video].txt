1. Start Windows Defender Firewall
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll practice
00:06
working with the Windows Defender Firewall.
00:09
Windows Defender Firewall is a host-based firewall.
00:12
It's implemented as software and
00:14
designed to protect an individual system.<br>
00:17
Be aware that Windows Defender Firewall was
00:19
previously referred to as Windows Firewall.
00:22
If you're on an older operating
00:23
system, it may go by that name.
00:26
However, it works basically the same.
00:28
Its job is to prevent someone on the internet or the network
00:31
from initiating an unwanted connection with a system.
00:34
It just shuts it down.<br>
00:36
To manage Windows Defender Firewall, I'll
00:39
click on Search and type firewall, then select
00:41
Windows Defender Firewall under Best match.
00:44
You can see that the Windows
00:45
Defender Firewall is currently Off.
00:48
Let's click Turn Windows Defender
00:50
Firewall on or off on the left.
00:52
You'll see two network profiles to which
00:55
the Windows Defender firewall is applied.
00:57
We have the Private network settings
00:59
and the Public network settings.<br>
01:01
The Private network settings can be a little
01:04
looser because we're assuming the company has a
01:06
network firewall that's already blocking many
01:09
connections, increasing the security level.
01:12
We're trying to protect this individual host.<br>
01:15
We want to customize the firewall for those
01:17
times when we connect to a public network.
01:20
Public networks, such as those defined at a
01:22
restaurant, a hotel, or an airport, are like
01:25
the wild, wild West of information technology.
01:28
You have no idea who's on the network or their intentions.
01:31
Therefore, you want to configure the Windows
01:33
Defender Firewall with more stringent settings
01:36
than when you're on a private network.<br>
01:38
For both our network profiles, you can see that the
01:41
Windows Defender Firewall is currently turned off.
01:44
We need that firewall on.
01:46
Select on for both.
01:48
The default settings work well for a private network.
01:51
We can see that we'll be notified if
01:53
Windows Defender Firewall blocks an app
01:54
trying to communicate through the firewall.
01:57
We'll have a list of apps allowed
01:59
to communicate through the firewall.<br>
02:01
That's probably appropriate.
02:03
We'll run certain applications that need to send
02:05
data back and forth through the host-based firewall.
02:09
So that's okay.
02:11
However, if I'm on a public network at an airport,
02:14
a hotel, or a similar place, we want to turn this
02:17
option on and block all incoming connections,
02:20
including those in the list of allowed apps.<br>
02:23
We don't want anyone on the public network
02:25
initiating a connection with this computer,
02:27
even if it's an allowed application.
02:30
We'll leave this option checked for
02:31
public network profiles and click OK.
02:34
The Windows Defender Firewall state
02:36
is on for incoming connections.<br>
2. Allow Apps Through the Firewall
02:39
Let's talk about allowing certain apps.
02:42
There may be times when you install an application that
02:44
legitimately needs to communicate through the Windows
02:46
Defender Firewall with other hosts on the network.
02:49
Still, by default, it's going to be blocked.
02:52
In that case, you can use the Allow an app
02:55
or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.
02:57
Let's select that.<br>
02:59
You can see a list of applications and
03:01
features that the Windows system is aware of.
03:03
You can also see whether they're
03:04
allowed through the firewall.
03:07
For example, scroll down to Remote Assistance.
03:11
Remote Assistance traffic is allowed through the
03:12
host firewall for private and public profiles.<br>
03:15
If there's an application that you need to allow through
03:18
the firewall, you can enable it using the checkbox.
03:21
For example, we've enabled Remote
03:23
Desktop for Public and Private profiles.
03:26
It's an app we frequently use for
03:28
testing all sorts of networks.<br>
3. Allow Custom Apps Through the Firewall
03:30
There may be situations where you want
03:32
to allow an application to communicate
03:33
through the Windows Defender Firewall.
03:35
Still, you can't find it in the list
03:37
because Windows hasn't recognized it.<br>
03:39
If that's the case, you can come down
03:42
here and click Allow another app.
03:44
Then, you locate the app.
03:46
We have an app in the Program
03:48
Files directory named VNC Viewer.
03:50
VNC Viewer allows you to connect to desktops
03:53
remotely for Windows, Linux, and other systems
03:55
that won't work with a Remote Desktop.<br>
03:59
We'll go ahead and select vncviewer.
04:02
Click Add.
04:03
Now you can see it's added.
04:05
We can configure it to allow traffic from
04:07
both the Public and Private network profiles.
04:10
That's how you add an app to the list of apps
04:11
that can communicate through the firewall.
04:14
Click OK.
04:15
Now, we've configured the Windows
04:17
Defender Firewall on the system.<br>
4. Summary
04:19
That's it for this demonstration.
04:21
In this demo, we talked about managing
04:23
the Windows Defender Firewall.
04:25
We first turned on the Windows Defender Firewall
04:27
and increased the security level of the Windows
04:29
Defender Firewall for the public profile.
04:32
We ended this demo by adding an exception to the firewall
04:36
to allow a specific application to communicate through it.<br>
