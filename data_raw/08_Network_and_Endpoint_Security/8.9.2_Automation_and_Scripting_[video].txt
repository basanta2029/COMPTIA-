1. Automation and Scripting
00:04
Automation is a powerful tool
00:05
for managing security operations.
00:07
Automation allows us to perform repetitive, rule-based
00:10
tasks to improve efficiency and reduce user errors.
00:14
Combining automation systems with orchestration
00:16
and scripting can make a huge difference in the
00:18
efficiency of security operations.
00:20
In this lesson, we'll go over these systems and
00:22
then look at the benefits and considerations of
00:24
automation, orchestration, and scripting.<br>
2. Automation Overview
00:28
Automation uses software to perform repetitive, rule-based
00:31
tasks, such as monitoring for threats, applying patches,
00:34
maintaining baselines, or responding to incidents, to
00:37
improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of human error.<br>
00:41
We can develop scripts to automate
00:42
many of the common repetitive tasks.
00:45
Scripts tell the system what steps
00:46
to take to automate the task.
00:48
Orchestration enhances automation by
00:51
coordinating and streamlining the interactions
00:53
between automated processes and systems.
00:56
Orchestration supports seamless and integrated
00:58
workflows, especially in large, complex environments
01:01
with many different security tools and systems.<br>
01:04
Scripting uses a specific language, such as
01:07
Python, JavaScript, or PowerShell, to perform
01:09
tasks on a computer or network system.
01:12
A script is typically a text file with commands
01:14
written that tell the system what to do step by step.<br>
01:17
Typical programs must be compiled before running, which
01:21
means the code's text must be converted into binary code.
01:25
Scripts, on the other hand, are
01:26
read and executed line by line.
01:29
Scripting languages are usually something
01:30
a human can look at and interpret, whereas
01:33
binary code is much more difficult to read.
01:35
When combined, scripting and automation
01:38
are critical tools in modern IT operations.<br>
01:41
For all of these different platforms and tools to
01:43
communicate with each other, we need to implement the
01:45
appropriate Application Programming Interface, or API.
01:49
An API simply serves as an interpreter between multiple
01:52
systems so they can all speak the same language.
01:55
Automation and orchestration systems
01:57
will need an appropriate API so they can
01:59
be integrated into the network systems.<br>
3. Benefits
02:02
Automation can help an organization to streamline
02:05
processes, enhance security, and improve efficiency.
02:08
For example, we can develop scripts to apply security
02:11
policies on network devices and use automation
02:13
software to help enforce the security policies.
02:16
Another example is using scripts to apply patches and
02:19
updates across the organization and automation tools to
02:22
track the changes and notify us if anything goes wrong.<br>
02:26
Using automation not only enhances the efficiency of
02:29
security operations but also reduces the burden on the
02:32
security team and reduces the likelihood of human error.
02:35
Security analysts must monitor numerous systems
02:38
for potential threats, manage high volumes of
02:40
alerts, including many false positives, and respond
02:43
to confirmed threats as quickly as possible.
02:45
These working conditions often lead to long hours, anxiety,
02:49
and elevated stress levels, resulting in operator fatigue.
02:53
This fatigue is a significant concern in cybersecurity
02:56
because it can lead to decreased alertness and cognitive
02:58
function and impair the ability of security personnel to
03:01
identify and respond to threats effectively.
03:04
Fatigue results in missed critical alerts,
03:06
slower response times, and a greater likelihood
03:09
of errors, any of which can compromise security.<br>
03:12
Having to perform common repetitive tasks, such as user
03:15
and resource provisioning, assigning security groups,
03:18
creating tickets, and other common tasks, can be minimized
03:21
by creating scripts and monitoring with automation tools.
03:25
This will greatly help reduce operator fatigue,
03:27
leading to fewer errors and better security operations.<br>
4. Considerations
03:31
While implementing automation can make the
03:33
job easier and more efficient, there are
03:35
some challenges we need to be aware of.
03:37
Appropriate automation and orchestration solutions
03:40
can be extremely complex and require a deep
03:43
knowledge and understanding of the organization's
03:45
systems, processes, and interdependencies.
03:48
A poorly planned or executed strategy will make
03:51
systems more difficult to manage and maintain.<br>
03:54
When implementing automation solutions,
03:56
the initial cost can be quite high.
03:58
Even though the organization will save
04:00
money in the long term, the high initial
04:02
cost can make it difficult to implement.
04:05
If a critical automated system or process fails,
04:07
this can impact multiple areas of the organization.
04:11
Having this single point of failure is
04:12
something that should be considered, and
04:14
proper mitigation steps should be implemented.<br>
04:17
If automation and orchestration systems are poorly
04:19
designed and implemented, this can lead to system
04:22
instability, complexity, and increased cost.
04:25
This is known as technical debt.
04:27
Lastly, automation systems require ongoing
04:30
support and updates to stay effective and secure.
04:33
Without proper support, these
04:34
systems will be quickly outdated.<br>
5. Summary
04:37
That'll wrap up this lesson on automation and scripting.
04:39
In this lesson, we first went over what
04:41
automation, orchestration, and scripting are.
04:44
We then looked at the benefits of using these
04:45
technologies, including reducing operator fatigue and
04:49
increasing the efficiency of our security operations.
04:51
We wrapped up by going over some concerns
04:53
that should be considered when implementing
04:55
automation orchestration solutions.<br>
