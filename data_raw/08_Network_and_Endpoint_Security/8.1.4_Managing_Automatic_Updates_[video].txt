1. Configure Windows Update on Windows
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to
00:06
talk about configuring Windows Update.<br>
00:08
As you probably know, every now and then, the
00:10
Windows operating system goes out to Microsoft's
00:12
site over the internet and checks whether there are
00:14
any updates available for the operating system.<br>
00:17
To manage updates on a Windows system, you
00:18
need to come down to your Windows icon.
00:21
Go to Settings and then Windows Update.<br>
00:23
On the Windows Update screen, I can
00:24
see the current status of my updates.
00:26
Right here, you can see when my device was last updated.
00:30
To be sure my system is up to date, I
00:31
can go here and select Check for updates.
00:34
When I do that, Windows tells me it's up to date.<br>
00:37
Under Advanced Options, we next have the
00:38
option to pause Windows updates for seven days.
00:40
When I select this option, it'll pause my updates.
00:44
And up here, you can see when the updates will resume.
00:46
I don't want to pause my updates,
00:47
so I'll click on Resume updates.<br>
2. Active Hours
00:49
This option allows us to set the active hours on our system.
00:53
A long time ago, when dinosaurs roamed the
00:54
earth, there was nothing worse than working on a
00:56
term paper and having Windows spontaneously
00:58
decide it was a great time to install an update.
01:01
The system would log you off, and hopefully,
01:03
you'd have a saved copy of your work.
01:05
If not, you might have to start all over.<br>
01:07
So, this option lets you set active hours to let the
01:10
device know when you typically work on your system.
01:13
This is to avoid updating when you're in the middle
01:15
of something without checking with you first.
01:17
I like to work a lot, so I'll put in 16 hours.
01:20
I'd like to change this to 7:00 a.m.
01:21
until about 11:00 p.m.<br>
3. Update History
01:24
Here, I can select Update History.
01:26
When I do, this Window appears, and I can see the
01:28
name of the updates and the date they were installed.
01:30
If I need to know more about what an update is, I can
01:33
click one of the links, and it takes me to the Microsoft
01:35
Knowledge Base site for that particular update.<br>
01:37
Below there are two options to be aware of.
01:40
One is Uninstall updates, and the other is Recovery options.
01:44
The Uninstall updates open another window
01:46
where you can uninstall certain updates.
01:48
However, some updates can't be removed from Windows.<br>
01:51
Recovery options take you to where you can do
01:53
a system reset, which isn't part of this demo.<br>
01:56
Let's go back a few clicks.<br>
4. Advanced Options
01:58
Under Advanced Options, we do other things,
02:00
like tell Windows to give us updates for
02:01
other Microsoft products when we update.
02:04
For example, I might want Office
02:05
to be updated when updates run.<br>
02:07
Here, we can tell Windows not to download
02:09
when connected to metered connections.
02:11
If we're connected to a cellular network and
02:13
paying for bandwidth, we might not want to do that.
02:16
Right now, that's off, and I'm going to leave it that way.<br>
02:18
Here, you can tell Windows to restart as soon as
02:20
possible when a restart is required to install an update.
02:23
If you have this turned on,
02:25
it'll warn you before restarting.
02:26
You can tell Windows to show a notification when your PC
02:29
requires a restart to finish an update by turning this On.<br>
5. Delivery Options
02:32
Okay, now let's move on to our delivery options.
02:35
We're going to talk about a more
02:36
advanced topic for a moment.
02:38
It's possible to set up an update server on your
02:40
local network and configure your workstations to
02:42
get your updates from that server.
02:44
This is a good option if you have a lot of workstations.<br>
02:47
Instead of having all these workstations in your
02:49
organization download the same files redundantly
02:52
from Microsoft, wasting bandwidth, we'd want to
02:55
download those updates once to the update server.
02:58
Then all the systems on your network would
02:59
get the updates from that local server.
03:02
Windows is taking that concept and making it more of
03:04
a peer-to-peer model instead of a client-server model.<br>
03:07
Essentially, what we can do is get
03:08
our updates from Microsoft directly.
03:10
We can also get updates from other workstations on our
03:12
network that have already downloaded that same update.
03:15
We can turn that functionality off or on right here.
03:19
By default, it's turned On.<br>
03:21
One option is only the PCs on my local
03:23
network, which is selected by default.
03:25
That's a pretty good idea.
03:27
If you're a little more trusting, you can also
03:28
get updates from computers out on the internet.
03:31
This option scares me since I have no idea what I'd be
03:33
getting from other computers, so I don't usually select it.<br>
03:37
Right below this, we have Advanced options.
03:39
Here, we can change the default settings for how
03:41
much bandwidth we'll allow Windows to use for
03:43
downloading and uploading updates on the system.
03:46
We'll click back a few times, which wraps up Windows Update.<br>
6. Device Updates in Windows Update
03:50
One last topic we need to cover before
03:52
we end this demonstration: how to include
03:54
device updates with Windows Update.
03:56
This is usually a very good idea.
03:58
The ironic thing is that finding this option can be
04:00
challenging because when Windows releases featured updates,
04:02
they often make things harder and harder to locate.
04:05
That's what happened to the device update options.<br>
04:08
First, we need to go to Bluetooth &amp; devices settings.
04:12
Now, go to Devices, More devices, and printer settings.
04:16
I'm going to right-click the PC icon.
04:18
From the menu, I'm going to select Device
04:20
installation settings on this system.<br>
04:22
Here, it says, Do you want to automatically
04:24
download manufacturers' apps and custom
04:26
icons available for your devices?
04:28
This is set to Yes by default.
04:30
I wanted to confirm that, so I'll leave it alone.<br>
7. Summary
04:33
That's it for this demonstration.
04:34
In this demo, we explained the
04:36
process of managing Windows Update.<br>
