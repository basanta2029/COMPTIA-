1. Preventing Cross-Site Scripting
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll explore the steps you
00:05
can take to safeguard yourself against cross-site
00:07
scripting attacks, commonly known as XSS attacks.
00:10
Although XSS attacks can exploit various
00:14
web technologies like HTML and Flash,
00:17
JavaScript is one of their primary vehicles.
00:19
Consequently, we'll focus on how to disable
00:22
JavaScript in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.<br>
2. Disable JavaScript in Microsoft Edge
00:25
Before we delve deeper into this demo, please be
00:27
aware that you can indeed prevent cross-site
00:29
scripting attacks by disabling JavaScript in web
00:32
browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.
00:35
However, it's crucial to understand that disabling
00:38
JavaScript can significantly impact the
00:40
functionality and user experience of many websites.
00:43
Please consider this trade-off carefully
00:45
before implementing such restrictions.<br>
00:48
Let's begin with Microsoft Edge.
00:50
I've already opened Edge, and now
00:51
we'll navigate to the settings.
00:53
Click on the three dots, also known
00:55
as the ellipsis, and select Settings.<br>
00:57
In the settings menu, go to Cookies and site permissions.
01:01
You'll find a list of items on the right.
01:03
Scroll down until you locate JavaScript.
01:06
Here, you can toggle off the switch next to
01:08
Allowed (recommended) to disable JavaScript.
01:11
In some versions of Edge, you might receive a confirmation
01:14
dialog; if so, click Turn off to confirm the action.
01:17
JavaScript is now disabled in Microsoft Edge.
01:20
To enable it again, simply follow the
01:22
same steps and toggle the switch back on.<br>
3. Disable JavaScript in Google Chrome
01:24
Let's switch to Google Chrome and
01:26
see how to disable JavaScript there.
01:28
Click on the three dots in the top
01:30
right corner, then select Settings.
01:32
Navigate to Privacy and security and click on Site settings.
01:36
Scroll down until you find JavaScript, and click on it.
01:39
Choose the radio button that says, Don't
01:41
allow sites to use JavaScript to disable it.
01:44
To enable JavaScript, simply select Sites
01:46
can use JavaScript to turn it back on.<br>
4. A Word About Autofill
01:48
It's also essential to mention the potential risks
01:51
associated with the browser's credential autofill feature.
01:54
This feature is often enabled by
01:56
default in most commonly used browsers.
01:58
To disable the ability to save passwords, go
02:01
to Autofill and passwords and click on it.
02:03
If you use Google Password Manager, you can
02:05
toggle off Google's offer to save passwords
02:08
and the ability to sign in automatically.
02:10
Remember that these settings can be adjusted as needed.<br>
5. Summary
02:13
In summary, the most effective prevention of
02:16
cross-site scripting is typically implemented
02:18
in the design of web applications.
02:20
However, as a user, you may not always know if
02:22
the sites you visit have taken all necessary
02:25
precautions to protect against XSS attacks.
02:28
Therefore, being able to disable JavaScript in your browser
02:31
can provide an additional layer of security when needed.
02:34
Just remember to weigh the potential loss of
02:36
website functionality against the security
02:38
benefits when deciding to disable JavaScript.<br>
