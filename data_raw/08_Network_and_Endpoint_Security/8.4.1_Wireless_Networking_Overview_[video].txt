1. Wireless Networking Overview
00:04
Wireless networking is now commonplace
00:06
in most network environments.
00:08
In fact, a lot of networks use it
00:10
as the primary connection method.
00:12
Chances are you probably have a
00:13
wireless network in your home.
00:15
In fact, setting up a residential
00:17
wireless network at home is pretty simple.
00:20
Even setting up the SSID broadcast and encryption
00:23
protocol on the access point is very straightforward.<br>
00:26
In an enterprise environment, setting
00:28
up a wireless network isn't as simple.
00:30
This is because there are additional considerations that
00:33
need to be taken into account in an enterprise environment.
00:36
But before we discuss the impact of wireless
00:38
devices in an enterprise network, let's highlight a
00:41
couple of things with consumer-grade home routers.<br>
2. SOHO Wireless
00:45
You probably only have a single
00:47
wireless access point at home.
00:49
This device is actually three devices in one: a
00:52
router, a switch, and a wireless access point.<br>
00:55
The router connects your home local
00:57
area network to the ISP's network.
01:00
The switch allows you to connect several
01:02
network devices together using an Ethernet
01:04
cable, most likely unshielded twisted pair.
01:07
The wireless access point allows for wireless
01:09
connections to the local area network.<br>
3. Enterprise Wireless
01:12
An enterprise wireless network is different from a
01:15
home wireless network in at least three different ways.
01:19
First, instead of having a single all-in-one
01:21
device, equipment is typically separated into
01:24
distinct components that perform a single function.
01:27
For example, a router only performs routing
01:30
operations, a switch only performs switching
01:32
operations, and a wireless access point only acts
01:35
as a bridge between the wireless and wired network.<br>
01:38
Second, enterprises need to support many more devices
01:42
and cover a much larger area than home networks.
01:45
Some enterprises need to support thousands of clients and
01:48
cover entire business complexes; for example, many
01:52
universities have wireless connectivity on the entire campus.<br>
01:56
And third, devices need to be able to move around
01:59
the enterprise without any connection troubles.
02:01
The transition between different
02:02
access points needs to be seamless.<br>
4. Access Points
02:05
In an enterprise network, this is done by using
02:07
multiple access points, which are scattered
02:11
throughout the campus to provide adequate coverage.
02:13
The access points will typically all connect to
02:17
the same local area network through a switch.<br>
02:19
Now, each of these access points can only support a
02:22
limited number of clients, so having multiple access points
02:26
also allows each access point to share the client load.
02:28
For example, if this switch has the maximum number of
02:32
connections, new wireless devices that require network access
02:36
will be connected to this access point, here, instead.
02:38
This is possible because the range of the access points
02:42
here overlap, which actually brings up another important
02:46
point: overlapping signals can cause interference.<br>
02:49
It's also possible for devices to constantly bounce
02:52
between connecting to this AP and this AP, and so on.
02:56
This could be really frustrating.
02:57
In addition, if any of these configuration settings
03:02
on either of these APs is different, then this can
03:04
cause connection issues, and the more APs you add to
03:07
a network, the more devices you need to manage.<br>
5. Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
03:09
As you can see, a wireless network can
03:12
quickly become a management nightmare.
03:13
Luckily, enterprise networks use a device
03:16
called a wireless LAN controller (WLC) that
03:19
manages all the access points in a network.
03:22
The typical enterprise wireless controller will be
03:25
in a networking closet and connected to a switch.
03:28
The controller can then communicate
03:29
with and manage each of these APs.<br>
03:33
In addition to managing configuration
03:35
settings, the controller can also manage
03:38
client connections and manage AP loads.
03:40
In essence, a wireless controller allows
03:43
multiple APs to work together as a single
03:46
system, instead of each working in isolation.<br>
03:48
It's important to know that a wireless controller
03:51
by itself doesn't actually produce any type of
03:54
wireless signal--that's the job of the AP.
03:56
The controller only manages the APs.<br>
6. LWAP
03:59
Another type of wireless device is known
04:02
as a light-weight access point, or LWAP.<br>
04:05
LWAPs are used in conjunction with a wireless controller.
04:10
LWAPs contain very little embedded
04:13
intelligence or technology.
04:15
They are connected to the wired network via a network
04:17
cable and are able to communicate directly with the
04:20
WLC, which handles things like client connections,
04:22
authentication, propagating configurations, et cetera.<br>
7. Wireless Technologies
04:27
Let's next look at the two ways a
04:29
wireless network can be configured.
04:31
The first one is ad hoc mode.<br>
04:34
In ad hoc mode, also called peer-to-peer mode
04:37
or wireless mesh mode, there is no WAP or WLC.
04:41
Instead, two or more wireless devices connect directly
04:44
with each other to send and receive information.
04:47
The more devices that connect, the more
04:50
individual connections that are made.
04:51
And you can see where the term wireless mesh comes
04:55
from when you see all these individual connections.<br>
04:57
The second mode is called infrastructure mode.
05:00
In infrastructure mode, a workstation communicates
05:03
with a notebook by sending the signal to the WAP
05:06
which transfers it to the notebook system.
05:08
The infrastructure mode is more scalable than ad hoc mode.
05:12
The infrastructure mode also makes it easy to
05:15
connect the wireless network to a wired network.
05:17
It is not easy to do that with an ad hoc implementation.<br>
05:20
Once you establish the wireless connection between the
05:24
network interface card and the WAP, the wireless network
05:27
operates similar to traditional wired Ethernet networks.<br>
8. Summary
05:31
Now, it's important to know that wireless networks
05:33
use what's called an unbounded medium to communicate.
05:36
That is, they send signals in all directions that
05:39
can be picked up by any device in range they aren't
05:42
bounded by insulated wires like wired networks.
05:46
Because of this, wireless networks are inherently less
05:48
secure than a bounded, wired network, so you need to
05:52
take extra precautions when securing a wireless network.<br>
