1. Hardening a Wireless Access Point
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to go through some
00:07
of the steps you can take to harden a wireless
00:10
network, and we're going to use a wireless controller.
00:12
This means we make changes on the controller itself,
00:15
and those changes propagate out to each of the access
00:18
points connected to it. The concepts in this demo
00:22
transfer to other types of wireless access points,
00:25
such as all-in-one small office/home office devices.
00:28
To start, we need to log in to our controller. I have a web
00:32
browser open, and I've entered the controller's IP address.
00:35
I'll enter the username, â€˜admin',
00:37
and password, and we're logged in.
2. Default Username and Password
00:41
The first thing we want to do is change the default username
00:44
and password for this device. This is the first thing you
00:47
should do with any networking device you're configuring. It's
00:50
very important that you change those defaults.
00:53
We do this on the Administer tab. Notice we can also choose
00:57
to use an authorization server if we want to, but just change
01:01
the default username to something else. We'll enter the old
01:04
password and then the new password. Click Apply.
01:10
The Admin session timeout setting is also on this page.
3. Session Timeout
01:14
This setting defines how much time must
01:17
pass before the user is automatically logged out.
01:20
This is a nice thing to have, as it keeps users from logging
01:23
in to the device and then walking away from it and leaving it
01:27
vulnerable. Let's change this to 10 minutes. Click Apply.
01:32
Now we're asked to log out and start a new session
01:35
with the new timeout setting. Click OK, and let's
01:37
log in with our new username and password.
01:41
Let's go to the Configure tab. There are a lot of settings
01:44
and options on this tab. On the System tab, we can specify
01:48
the IP address and subnet mask to use on the network.
01:52
It's good to change this from a typical IP address range,
01:56
as it adds another layer of security, but we'll leave it
01:59
how it is for now. Let's go to the Access Points page.
02:02
On this page, we can see all the access points
02:06
connected to the wireless controller.
4. Access Point Management and Configuration
02:08
Right now, we only have one AP, or access
02:11
point, connected. If we wanted to, we could
02:14
click Edit and change the configuration.
02:17
Notice that all these options require us to override the
02:20
group configuration. Remember, this is a wireless
02:23
controller. As such, it controls the configuration options
02:27
for each access point in the network.
02:30
If we want to change the settings on a specific access
02:33
point (for example, change the channel it's using), we
02:36
can do that here. For now, let's click Cancel.
02:40
Under Access Point Groups, any changes to this configuration
02:44
will be applied to all the APs in the network. This makes
02:47
managing networks with multiple APs very easy. All the
02:51
settings look good, so let's just click Cancel.
5. WAN Configuration
02:55
On the WLANs page, we can create wireless LANs--that
02:58
is, we can create multiple wireless networks, each
03:01
specified by an SSID. For example, we currently have
03:06
three different WLANs configured on this
03:08
controller. Let's edit the DevRuckusAP network.
03:12
Here, we can see the configuration of this
03:14
network and that it's defined as a standard
03:17
network. We can also configure the authentication
03:20
options. Right now, the authenticate type is open.
03:24
We could configure this to connect to a
03:26
RADIUS server, specify that it use MAC
03:28
address authentication, or use a combination of the
03:31
two. We can also configure the encryption method.
03:35
We're using WPA2 with the AES algorithm. You can
03:39
see we have a very weak passphrase
03:41
configured, which is fine for a demo, but make sure
03:44
you use a complex passphrase with this encryption.
03:48
Down here, we can also configure the WLAN to use a captive
03:52
portal. The Wireless Client Isolation option allows us
03:56
to configure the network to isolate each connected client.
04:00
There are also a lot of advanced options we won't
04:03
get into, but remember there's a lot of customization
04:06
that can happen with these types of wireless controllers
04:09
that you just can't find in smaller, consumer-grade
04:11
devices. Leave everything as it is and click Cancel.
04:16
Let's look at the configuration of the Guest network. Notice
04:20
the type is defined as Guest, which causes our guest access
04:24
policies and access control settings to be applied.
04:28
We also need to note that we're using open authentication
04:31
with no encryption. This is an open, unsecure guest
04:34
network. That's why we're isolating wireless client
04:38
traffic from each other. It's good idea to have
04:41
this option enabled on guest networks. Click Cancel, and
04:44
let's go to the Access Control page.
6. Access Control Configuration
04:47
On this page, we can configure how client access
04:50
is controlled. For example, under L2-L7 Access
04:54
Control, we can define MAC address control lists
04:57
that can be used with a specific WLAN.
05:01
To define MAC address control lists, add all the
05:04
MAC addresses you want to give network access to and
05:07
then enable MAC address filtering on the specific WLAN
05:11
to use that list. We can also do this by IP address.
05:16
Under Device Access Policy, we can permit or deny clients
05:20
based on their device specifications. For example, we could
05:23
deny all clients using a particular operating system.
05:28
Application Recognition and Filtering is another
05:31
useful feature. It lets us block traffic based on port,
05:35
IP address, protocol, and other characteristics.
05:38
We configure this by looking at our access
05:40
points' logs and identifying the different types
05:43
of traffic. We would then take that information
05:46
and decide if we want to block anything.
05:49
Let's go back up to the device access policy and
05:52
define a rule. We're going to create a rule
05:55
that blocks traffic from video game consoles. We'll
05:58
name the rule and add a description. Click Create New.
06:05
Notice, under OS/Type, that we have an option for
06:08
gaming. This identifies traffic generated by
06:12
video game consoles, such as an Xbox or PlayStation
06:16
console. We want to deny this traffic, so we'll select
06:19
Deny from the rule type dropdown. Click Save > OK.
06:21
There's a number of other features on this controller that
06:27
you can use. We can add roles and policies that affect users,
06:31
and we can add users to the device. We can also configure the
06:35
controller to notify us of specific events via email.
06:40
On the Services page, we can configure self-healing and
06:43
background scanning, which are both very useful feature,
06:45
but they're outside the scope of this video. We can also
06:50
configure wireless intrusion detection.
7. Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (WIPS)
06:53
Wireless intrusion detection and prevention system
06:54
(WIPS) is, actually, a very useful feature. It
06:59
helps protect against wireless attacks such
07:01
as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rogue access
07:05
points, evil twin attacks, and rogue DHCP servers.
07:09
For example, we can protect against repeated
07:11
authentication attacks right here. We can even specify
07:15
how long a client will be blocked. This helps protect
07:19
our system from DoS attacks and brute force attacks.
07:22
We can also configure the controller to
07:24
automatically flag APs trying to spoof an SSID or
07:29
MAC address as a malicious device. This is a great
07:32
tool for protecting against evil twin attacks.
8. Summary
07:36
That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we
07:39
discussed some of the things you can do to harden a
07:42
wireless network using a wireless network controller.
