1. File Server Security
00:04
File servers are an attractive target because they
00:07
almost always store some type of valuable data, such as
00:09
client contacts, credit card information, employee files,
00:13
company performance records--the list goes on and on.
00:16
In this lesson, we'll look at some steps you should take
00:19
to properly secure your organization's file servers.
00:22
Let's start by looking at some of the best practices
00:24
you should follow when it comes to file server security.
00:27
Keep in mind that these are generic best practices that can
00:30
be applied to any type of file server, whether it's a
00:33
dedicated NAS, a SAN, a Microsoft server, or a Linux server.
2. Best Practices
00:37
The first best practice is to keep
00:39
all file servers physically secure.
00:41
Remember, it's very easy for someone to gain access to
00:44
data if they have physical access to a system, so employ
00:47
the appropriate physical controls with your file servers
00:50
as you would with any other networking hardware device.
00:53
Next, is the principle of least privilege.
00:55
This is the concept that users should only have access
00:58
to the information and resources that are necessary for
01:01
them to perform their job, and that's it.
01:03
They shouldn't have any more privileges than they need.
01:06
This helps prevent privilege creep, where a
01:08
user slowly accumulates more and more
01:11
privilege than they need to perform their job.
01:14
Another best practice is to use full-disk
01:17
encryption on all storage mediums.
01:19
This may or may not be possible for your
01:21
organization depending on its policies.
01:23
Encrypting an entire drive and keeping it encrypted as
01:26
people work requires a significant amount of resources.
01:30
Due to this resource overhead, it might not
01:32
be feasible to use full-disk encryption.
01:34
Instead, you might want to
01:36
consider only encrypting backups.
01:38
Another option is to fully decrypt drives when they're
01:41
powered on and encrypt them when the system shuts down.
01:44
This may not prevent someone from transferring
01:46
files to a USB drive, but does prevent someone
01:49
physically stealing the entire drive or server.
01:53
Another security best practice that applies to almost
01:55
every system, not just files servers, is to remove
01:59
unnecessary software and disable unused services.
02:02
You can think of this as a principle
02:04
of least privilege with applications.
02:06
In other words, you should only have the
02:08
applications and services that are necessary for
02:10
the file server to function, and nothing more.
02:13
Having unused applications or services
02:15
increases the attack surface area of a system
02:18
and makes securing it that much harder.
02:21
In addition, the system is more
02:22
susceptible to zero-day attacks.
02:26
The next practice you should employ is auditing.
02:28
Make sure that your file server has proper auditing
02:31
enabled that can track user behavior, such as when
02:34
files are accessed, modified, deleted, and moved.
02:37
This helps you identify abnormal behavior
02:39
on the system and can even help you detect
02:41
that your system has been compromised.
02:43
The last security best practice is to use
02:46
implicit deny access control lists, or ACLs.
02:48
ACLs control the system's permission.
02:52
A good security practice is to prevent
02:54
access to everything that isn't explicitly
02:56
granted.
02:57
In other words, deny access to everyone except
03:00
people with explicitly granted permissions.
03:03
This control is a part of the concept
03:04
of least privilege mentioned earlier.
03:07
The opposite of implicit deny is explicit deny, meaning that
03:11
you're only looking for people you want to deny access to.
03:14
The problem with this approach is that you have to do a
03:16
bit of guesswork and research to deny access to files.
03:19
And if you happen to forget about a particular
03:21
group or file tree, you could inadvertently
03:24
give everyone access to sensitive files.
03:27
As a result, your system will be
03:28
more secure if you use implicit deny.
3. Secure Protocols vs. Unsecure Protocols
03:31
At some point, we all need to download or transmit
03:34
files using the internet, which is inherently unsecure.
03:37
Let's talk about different ways files
03:39
can be transmitted across a network.
03:41
Some of these protocols are secure, and some aren't.
03:44
As a security administrator, you need to know the difference
03:47
and decide which of these protocols to use on your systems.
03:51
File Transfer Protocol, or FTP, is an older TCP/IP
03:55
protocol that's used for transferring files across systems.
03:58
It was adopted as a TCP/IP standard through RFC 959 in 1985.
04:05
FTP is inherently unsecure since it doesn't
04:07
encrypt data, including usernames and passwords.
04:10
As such, FTP shouldn't be used for transferring sensitive
04:13
data over an unsecure network such as the internet.
04:17
Another problem with FTP is that
04:19
it allows anonymous user access.
04:21
This option can be disabled, but it's still a security risk.
04:25
If you must use FTP, there are ways to use it more
04:28
securely by pairing it with an encryption protocol.
04:31
There are a couple of ways to do this.
04:34
The first way is to use a VPN connection
04:36
that wraps all communications, FTP packets
04:39
included, in an encrypted data packet.
04:42
This would encrypt all traffic between
04:44
the host and the FTP file server.
04:46
IPsec or SSH can be used to create secure
04:49
tunneling with FTP to secure the transmission.
04:53
When use with an SSH tunnel, FTP is
04:55
called FTP over SSH, or Secure FTP.
05:00
Another way is to use FTPS.
05:01
FTPS uses SSL and TLS encryption
05:05
to secure data transmissions.
05:07
FTPS is similar to HTTPS in that it uses the SSL and TLS
05:09
cryptographic protocols to secure communications and also
05:16
requires the use of SSL certificates to encrypt traffic.
05:21
Another protocol that you can use
05:22
is the Secure Copy Protocol, or SCP.
05:24
SCP is similar to the Linux copy command cp.
05:27
SCP uses the Secure Shell Protocol,
05:31
or SSH, which is a secure tunnel.
05:33
SCP is an older protocol that's entirely text-basedâ€”that
05:36
is, you need to type the command, including the
05:40
directories to transmit, into a command line interface.
05:44
While it's secure, it doesn't offer
05:46
any type of directory traversing.
05:49
As a replacement for SCP, you can use SFTP.
05:52
SFTP stands for Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol.
05:57
Files are transferred through an SSH tunnel.
05:59
SFTP isn't related to FTP at all.
06:03
They're two completely different, incompatible protocols.
06:06
SFTP typically uses SSH v2, the more
06:10
secure version of Secure Shell Protocol.
06:13
It uses a graphical interface, and it's more user-friendly.
4. Summary
06:17
That's it for this lesson.
06:19
In this video, we discussed several best
06:20
practices that can be used to secure your file
06:23
servers and your organization's resources.
06:25
We also discussed how to use an encrypted protocol to
06:28
reduce the opportunity for an attacker to see sensitive
06:30
information as you copy files across a network.
