1. Wireless Installation
00:04
When you set up a wireless network, you can't just put
00:07
up a bunch of wireless access points and call it a day.
00:10
There are different installation considerations
00:11
you'll need to look at before installing your devices.
00:14
The first step is to understand and define
00:16
the usage needs of your wireless network.
00:19
Once you know them, it's time to conduct a site survey.
00:22
In this lesson, we're going to
00:24
discuss the site survey process.
2. Site Surveys
00:26
A site survey ensures that the wireless
00:28
network will perform as desired.
00:30
It examines the physical layout and barriers
00:32
of the location, which lets you determine
00:34
where to install the access points.
00:37
Multiple site surveys will be completed
00:39
during the installation process.
00:41
There are three different types of site surveys
00:43
performed at different times in the installation process:
00:47
passive surveys, active surveys, and predictive surveys.
00:50
If a survey isn't conducted properly, your network
00:53
won't perform, and that will cost a lot more time
00:56
and money than performing surveys correctly.
00:59
To conduct a survey, you'll need to use a Wi-Fi analyzer.
01:03
A dedicated Wi-Fi analyzer tool can provide an in-depth
01:06
look at the wireless signals in the area being tested.
01:09
There are also several Wi-Fi analyzers programs
01:12
you can run from a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
01:14
Before you perform a survey, you need
01:17
a diagram or map of your location.
01:20
It's important to make sure that the map is properly
01:22
scaled and labeled so you can get a proper reading.
01:25
Many analyzer tools allow you to import the
01:27
map so you can overlay the survey results.
3. Passive Survey
01:30
The initial survey is a passive survey.
01:33
This survey is performed without the analyzer
01:35
connecting to any specific wireless access point.
01:38
It's just in a listen-only mode.
01:41
Temporary WAPs are placed, and the surveyor
01:43
walks around with the analyzer to measure
01:45
signal strength and interference levels.
01:48
Once the passive survey has been
01:50
completed, a heat map is generated.
01:52
A heat map shows Wi-Fi signal strength.
01:55
They usually show strong signals in green,
01:57
medium levels in yellow, and weak spots in red.
02:01
You may need to perform multiple passive surveys to
02:03
determine the best placement for your access points.
02:06
You also need to make sure that the WAPs are installed in
02:08
secure locations so people can't physically access them.
02:12
Once you've figured out where to install the WAPs and
02:14
installed them, you should conduct an active survey.
4. Active Survey
02:18
During an active survey, you'll first connect the
02:20
Wi-Fi analyzer to the access points to measure the
02:23
network strength and look for any weak spots.
02:25
Then you'll walk through the entire location
02:27
again to thoroughly test every inch.
02:29
You can also generate heat maps again
02:31
to visually represent problem areas.
02:34
You also need to check for channel overlapping.
02:36
If neighboring access points are set to overlapping
02:39
channels, you'll end up dealing with performance issues and
02:41
network drops as devices move between the different WAPs.
5. Predictive Survey
02:46
The last type of site survey is a predictive survey.
02:49
Predictive surveys use software programs to load the
02:51
building blueprints and determines where to install the WAPs.
02:55
This can be done remotely and doesn't require someone
02:57
to walk through the location to test everything.
03:00
A predictive survey isn't as precise as a passive or
03:02
active survey, but it can cost less and take less time.
6. Summary
03:06
That's it for this lesson.
03:08
In this lesson, we talked about the
03:09
process of installing a wireless network.
03:11
Before we can do anything, we need to
03:13
know the usage needs of the network.
03:15
Then you can perform passive, active, and predictive
03:18
site surveys to determine how to install your WAPs.
