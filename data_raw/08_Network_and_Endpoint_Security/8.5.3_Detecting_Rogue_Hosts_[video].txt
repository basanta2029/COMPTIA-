1. Detecting Rogue Hosts
00:04
In this demo, we're going to configure our
00:06
wireless controller to detect rogue hosts and
00:08
look at other features wireless controllers have.
00:11
Some of these features help with rogue host detection.
00:14
If you remember, a rogue host is an
00:16
unauthorized access point within your network
00:18
or a different network in the surrounding area.
00:21
Let's start by logging in to our controller.
00:26
On the main page, we have some statistics that can be useful
00:29
for seeing what's going on with your wireless networks.
00:32
We're going to check to see if this controller
00:34
is set up for detecting rogue hosts.
00:36
Let's go to Insight > Untrusted Rogue APs.
00:40
Notice there are no APs listed in this section.
00:43
To populate this list, we're going to have
00:44
to trigger a scan to look for these them.
2. Access Point Settings
00:47
Under Access Points, we're going to
00:48
click the one access point we have.
00:50
This first window shows details related to the access point.
00:54
Now we're going to go to Configuration and see what
00:56
kind of settings we have available for this AP.
00:58
IP Setting allows you to set DHCP or static addresses.
01:02
If settings are set to DHCP, you can specify
01:05
a failback IP address, MASK, and gateway.
01:09
Radio gives you several options to tweak, such
01:11
as mode, channel width, channel, and TX power.
01:15
Some controllers have an auto mode
01:17
for Tx power, but this one doesn't.
01:19
Load balance provides options
01:20
for balancing connected clients.
01:23
Max associated clients can be set so once that
01:26
threshold is hit, load balancing is triggered.
01:29
RSSI Threshold is a signal strength setting.
01:33
If the client's signal is weaker than the set RSSI
01:35
threshold, it'll disconnect the client from the AP.
01:38
WLANs show which wireless networks
01:41
are set up with this access point.
01:43
You can override each access point if you
01:45
don't want the same SSIDs on each access point.
01:48
LED is just the indicator light on the access point.
01:51
The last setting we're going to
01:52
look at is Rogue AP Detection.
01:55
This is the scan button we use to scan for Rogue APs.
01:57
Let's start a scan.
01:59
Depending on how many surrounding networks
02:01
there are, it could take several minutes.
02:05
Great, the scan has completed.
02:06
Let's go take a look at the list.
3. Manage Rogue Devices
02:10
We're going to go back to insight
02:11
and then to the Untrusted Rouge APs.
02:15
This will show us some details related
02:16
to information gathered during the scan.
02:19
Let filter them so we know which APs
02:21
are the closest by signal strength.
02:24
You can see we have one AP that's
02:25
close with -46 signal strength.
02:28
Sometimes, it's even possible to see the
02:29
device's location on a map with other solutions.
02:32
We have two options for rogue APs: we can trust
02:35
them, or we can delete them from the list.
02:37
The Tp-link Omada controller already knows that it's an
02:40
untrusted AP, and it'll remain that way unless we trust it.
02:44
Let's say we know about this
02:45
device, so we'll mark it as trusted.
02:47
The device was removed from the untrusted
02:49
list, and now it's on the Trusted APs list.
02:52
There could be a time where you may want to remove a
02:54
trusted rouge AP and put it back on the untrusted list.
02:58
To do that, you click the Untrust button.
03:01
Now the SSID network NotYourWifi
03:03
is back on the untrusted list.
03:05
It's important to know that this rogue device detection
03:08
feature is just one step in protecting your network.
03:11
If you were to identify a very suspect rogue device
03:14
here, you would probably want to take additional
03:16
steps, such as using an RF scanner to pinpoint the
03:19
device and physically remove it from your organization
03:21
or find the building where the network is coming from.
03:24
Not all rogue APs are expected to be on your network,
03:27
as other users may set up APs for their own use.
4. Summary
03:30
That's it for this demo.
03:31
In this demo, we discussed the configuration
03:33
of various features on a wireless controller.
03:35
We looked at various settings we can control with an AP.
03:38
We also looked at how you can manage rogue devices.
