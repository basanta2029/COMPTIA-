1. Wireless Authentication and Access Methods
00:04
Wireless networks encrypt communications using a
00:08
security protocol, which is typically WPA2 or WPA3.
00:11
But in order to authenticate users and distribute
00:16
authentication keys, other methods are generally used.
00:19
In this lesson, we'll go over some of the different
00:22
access methods we can implement to connect to a
00:25
wireless network as well as the authentication
00:27
protocols we often find in enterprise environments.
2. Access Methods
00:31
Depending on the environment, we can use different
00:33
methods to connect users to a wireless network.
00:36
Let's take a look at some of these methods.
3. Pre-Shared Key
00:38
The first and probably most common access
00:41
method is to use a pre-shared key, or PSK.
00:42
A PSK is simply a passphrase that
00:47
we type in to connect to a network.
00:49
If we don't want to type in the passphrase to
00:52
connect each and every device, we can use Wi-Fi
00:54
Protected Setup, or WPS, to simplify the process.
4. Wi-Fi Protected Setup
00:58
WPS only works with a network that
01:01
uses a pre-shared key and WPA2.
01:05
On the access point, there's usually a button that
01:08
makes WPA2 start to search for devices in range.
01:12
On the connecting device, there's probably a WPS button
01:15
that automatically joins the device to the access point.
01:18
You need to enter a unique eight-number access point pin
01:22
if the connecting device doesn't have a button like this.
01:25
Some devices and access points can also use
01:28
Near Field Communication, or NFC, during the
01:30
WPS process to connect to each other.
5. Open Network
01:33
Our other option is to simply have an open network.
01:36
This means that no authentication takes place,
01:39
and anyone can connect to the network at will.
01:42
This should only be used by public establishments
01:45
that want to offer free wireless access.
6. Captive Portal
01:48
Many open networks implement a captive portal.
01:51
Captive portals force a user to view and
01:53
interact with them before accessing the network.
01:56
Basically, you're initially able connect
01:59
your device to the wireless network.
02:01
But before you can access the internet,
02:03
you're redirected to a captive portal page.
02:06
You might be prompted to agree to the
02:08
network's terms and conditions or maybe even
02:10
asked to pay a fee before you can proceed.
02:13
These portals are used a great deal today,
02:15
and you've most likely used one before.
7. Authentication Protocols
02:18
In an enterprise environment, using
02:20
a PSK isn't very secure or efficient.
02:23
Enterprise networks usually make use the 802.1x
02:28
Protocol to authenticate users to the wireless network.
8. 802.1x
02:33
802.1x authentication is one of the most secure
02:36
ways to enforce wireless network authentication.
02:39
On a wired network, once a user is authenticated,
02:42
the port they're connected to is activated.
02:45
The port remains off if the user's activation fails.
02:48
We can implement the 802.1x Protocol in a wireless network
02:53
by enabling a virtual port when the user is authenticated.
02:57
There are three components to an 802.1x setup.
03:01
The first is the supplicant, or wireless client.
03:04
Then we have the authenticator, which is responsible
03:07
for handling the communications between the supplicant
03:10
and the authentication serverâ€”the third component.
03:14
Know that oftentimes, the authentication
03:16
server is a RADIUS server.
03:18
When you use a RADIUS server, the authenticator is
03:21
also known as the network access server, or NAS.
9. RADIUS
03:25
RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In Service.
03:29
It was developed in 1991 and was originally used to
03:32
authenticate users to remote networks over dial-up networks.
03:36
We still use it today to remotely authenticate users.
03:40
Obviously, though, we don't do this over dial-up
03:42
connections anymore, which are more or less antiquated.
03:46
RADIUS is known as a triple-A protocol,
03:48
meaning that it provides authentication,
03:51
authorization, and accounting management.
03:54
When using 802.1x with RADIUS, the client sends
03:59
their credentials to the authenticator, or NAS.
04:01
The NAS forwards the credentials
04:03
to the RADIUS server to verify.
04:05
If you use a Windows server, this
04:07
is done using Active Directory.
04:09
Then the server sends back the verification and user
04:12
rights to the NAS, which forwards them back to the client.
04:15
Then the client can access network resources.
04:18
Using 802.1x authentication significantly
04:22
increases your wireless network security.
04:24
To ensure that the authentication information being
04:27
sent between these devices is secure, the Extensible
04:31
Authentication Protocol, or EAP, is used.
04:34
EAP isn't actually a specific protocol; it's
04:37
merely a framework in which other protocols work.
04:40
As a security administrator, you need to be
04:42
familiar with several different EAP protocols.
04:46
Let's start by looking at the Protected
04:48
Extensible Authentication Protocol, or PEAP.
10. PEAP
04:50
PEAP was created collaboratively by
04:53
Cisco, Microsoft, and RSA Security.
04:57
This protocol encapsulates the authentication
05:00
communications within a TLS tunnel and exclusively uses
05:03
a server-side certificate to authenticate Wi-Fi clients.
05:07
This simplifies network implementation and administration.
11. EAP-FAST
05:11
Next, we have EAP Flexible Authentication
05:14
via Secure Tunneling, or EAP-FAST.
05:16
EAP-FAST was created by Cisco, and it works
05:21
by making a TLS tunnel that doesn't require
05:24
an authentication server certificate.
05:26
Instead, this protocol uses a Protected Access
05:29
Credential, or PAC, to authenticate users.
05:33
Then, we have EAP Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TLS.
05:36
EAP-TLS is the original and probably most secure
05:41
of the wireless EAP authentication protocols.
05:45
Because it's the original, it's
05:46
also the most widely supported.
12. EAP-TLS
05:48
The nice thing about EAP-TLS is that it requires client-side
05:53
certificates in addition to server-side certificates.
05:56
The certificate fully encrypts the authentication handshake
05:59
between client and server and is then used in place of a
06:02
password, making it practically impossible to crack.
06:06
But because each client
06:07
requires an installed CA-signed PKI certificate,
06:09
EAP-TLS is much more labor intensive and
06:15
expensive to implement than other protocols.
13. EAP-TTLS
06:18
The final protocol is EAP Tunneled
06:20
Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TTLS.
06:22
EAP-TTLS is essentially an updated version of EAP-TLS.
06:29
The biggest difference is that we
06:31
only need a certificate on the server.
06:33
This greatly simplifies the implementation process since
06:36
we don't need a certificate on each wireless device.
06:39
EAP-TTLS has been supported natively since Windows 8.
06:44
By using the right authentication protocol, you
06:47
can greatly increase your wireless network's
06:49
security and further protect it from attacks.
14. Summary
06:53
That'll wrap up this lesson.
06:55
In this lesson, we looked at the different wireless
06:57
network access methods we can implement, including
07:01
pre-shared keys, server authentication, and open networks.
07:05
We also went over how WPS and captive portals work.
07:09
Then we saw the various authentication methods
07:12
that can be used for wireless networks.
07:15
First, we looked at RADIUS and how
07:16
it utilizes 802.1x authentication.
07:21
We finished up by looking at the different EAP protocols,
07:24
which include PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS.
