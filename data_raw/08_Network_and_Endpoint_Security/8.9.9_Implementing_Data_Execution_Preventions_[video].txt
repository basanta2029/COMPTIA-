1. Implementing Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to practice
00:07
working with Data Execution Prevention, or DEP.<br>
00:10
DEP is a set of hardware and software technologies designed
00:13
to prevent malicious code from running on a Windows system.<br>
00:17
DEP looks for and blocks a malicious program or any
00:21
other type of attack that has injected a process
00:23
with malicious code and is trying to run that code.
00:26
Let's look at how this works.<br>
2. Enable DEP on a Windows System
00:28
Let's start with a Windows system.
00:30
If I right-click Start, select System, come over to Advanced
00:38
system settings, go to Performance Settings on the Advanced
00:42
tab, and then go to the Data Execution Prevention tab.
00:47
In Windows Server 2022, DEP is enabled by default
00:51
for all programs, except those the user selects.<br>
00:54
It's possible that DEP will trigger a false positive.
00:57
This means that DEP thinks a legitimate process that's
01:00
running on the system is malicious and shuts it down.<br>
01:03
This is particularly relevant in situations
01:05
where you have in-house programmers who create
01:08
custom applications for your organization.<br>
01:10
In-house developed applications sometimes aren't as
01:13
rigorously tested, so they might kick off an exception where
01:16
DEP detects them and thinks that they're malicious code.<br>
3. Identify DEP Exceptions
01:19
But notice you do have the option to
01:21
turn off DEP for specific applications.
01:24
We have a case where we can do that on this system.<br>
01:27
I'm going to come down here to File Explorer.
01:30
If I go to my C: drive, then into Program
01:33
Files, and then to the SalesBuilder folder,
01:36
there's an application called SalesBuilder.<br>
01:39
This is an in-house written application.
01:41
It wasn't extensively tested and will kick
01:44
off an exception when we try to run it if
01:46
DEP is monitoring all system processes.<br>
01:49
Let's hit Add and go to Program Files
01:52
&gt; SalesBuilder &gt; SalesBuilder.exe.
01:56
Now DEP is turned on for everything except SalesBuilder.
01:59
We hit Apply.<br>
02:00
Verify that DEP is Enforced<br>
02:03
DEP is now enforced.
02:05
DEP is now on for all services except SalesBuilder.<br>
02:08
This means that whenever a process is run on this
02:11
system, whether it's a service or application, DEP
02:14
will watch it and look for any instance where it's
02:17
trying to run code from places that it shouldn't.
02:19
Except, of course, for the one application that I
02:22
specified earlier, SalesBuilder, which DEP was told
02:25
not to worry about because I know that I trust it.<br>
4. Summary
02:28
That's it for this demonstration.
02:30
In this demo, we configured Data
02:32
Execution Prevention, or DEP.<br>
