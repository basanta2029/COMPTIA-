1. Wireless Attacks
00:04
Because wireless networks use an unbounded communication
00:07
method, they're especially vulnerable to attacks.
00:09
This includes all types of wireless networks,
00:11
as in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, and even NFC.
00:15
In this lesson, I'm going to go over the
00:17
various attacks that threaten wireless networks.<br>
2. Wi-Fi Attacks
00:19
Because network security is a top priority, it's
00:22
common for network administrators to implement
00:24
stringent rules and limit website access.
00:27
Some users find this very frustrating.<br>
3. Rogue Access Point
00:29
To try to evade these rules, users sometimes
00:31
install an access point on their own computer.
00:34
This is known as a soft access point.
00:36
A network hacker who has gained access to a network,
00:39
perhaps using MAC spoofing, might do the same.
00:42
This is called a rogue access point
00:44
or an unauthorized association.<br>
00:46
Here's the big problem—most employees don't
00:48
understand the importance of securing their
00:50
soft access point or even how to do it.
00:53
So they just leave it open to hackers.
00:55
When an attacker discovers an access point, they're
00:57
able to run various types of vulnerability scanners
01:00
from outside the company, perhaps from a car or
01:03
adjacent building or even from several miles away.
01:06
Keep in mind that if a hacker can gain some type
01:08
of physical access to your company, they can also
01:10
hide a physical rogue access point as well.
01:13
This is often done by configuring an
01:14
extremely compact and powerful hardware device
01:17
called a Raspberry Pi as their access point.<br>
4. Evil Twin Attack
01:20
A rogue access point that's placed on the
01:22
network by a malicious attacker can be used
01:24
to run what's called an evil twin attack.
01:27
Here's how this works—say your organization currently
01:29
has a wireless network with a SSID of MyCompanyWiFi.
01:31
The attacker configures their own access point with the
01:36
same SSID and places it near the organization's building.
01:41
Then the attacker uses a jamming or disassociation
01:43
attack to knock users off the legitimate network.
01:46
When users reconnect to the network, they're now
01:49
connecting to the attacker's access point instead.<br>
01:52
Once a victim is connected to a rogue access point,
01:54
the attacker can capture all data flowing through it.
01:57
The user shouldn't notice anything different
01:59
since their internet is still running like normal.
02:01
These attacks are extremely dangerous as the attacker gains
02:04
immediate access to all sorts of sensitive information.<br>
02:08
To defend against these attacks, you should perform
02:10
regular site surveys to locate any rogue access points.
02:13
Your wireless networks encrypt data,
02:15
which helps protect against sniffing.
02:18
But some older standards, like WEP, are vulnerable due
02:20
to improperly configured initialization vectors, or IVs.<br>
5. Initialization Vectors
02:25
When we encrypt data, we use a secret key that only we know.
02:28
If we use the same key for everything we encrypt,
02:31
it won't take long for the key to be compromised.
02:33
This is where initialization vectors can help out.
02:36
The IV is a random string that's added to the key to
02:39
create a different key for each encryption process.
02:43
Unfortunately, if we don't configure the
02:44
IV properly, it can open us up to attacks.<br>
02:47
Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP, was one
02:50
of the first wireless security protocols
02:52
that used IVs to help with encryption.
02:54
The problem, though, was the IV was only
02:56
24 bits long and the key was 40 bits.
02:59
This meant there was only approximately 16
03:00
million different IVs that could be generated.
03:04
This may sound like a lot, but it actually meant that an
03:07
IV would be repeated at least once every 4096 packets.
03:11
It doesn't take much time to get 4096 packets, and
03:14
attackers were able to develop programs that would
03:17
flood the network with packets to find matching IVs.
03:20
Once an attacker gets multiple IVs, they
03:22
can begin decrypting the encryption key.
03:25
After that, all communication is open and no longer secure.<br>
03:28
No networks should use WEP anymore.
03:30
Newer wireless standards such as WPA-2
03:33
don't even use IVs for encryption.
03:35
For many of these wireless attacks to work, the
03:37
attacker needs to kick everyone off the legitimate
03:40
network and prevent them from reconnecting.
03:42
They attempt this with jamming
03:44
attacks or disassociation attacks.<br>
6. Jamming Attack
03:46
A Wi-Fi jamming attack requires a special device that works
03:50
by analyzing the spectrum used by wireless networks and then
03:52
transmitting a powerful signal on the same frequencies.
03:56
Basically, the jammer tries to be the
03:57
loudest voice in the room so nearby devices
04:00
can't see the legitimate wireless network.
04:02
The hope is that they disconnect
04:04
and are unable to reconnect again.
04:06
Jamming devices are illegal and
04:07
difficult to come by, though.<br>
7. Disassociation Attack
04:08
A disassociation attack, on the other
04:11
hand, can be performed with a laptop.
04:13
This is also know as a deauthentication attack.
04:16
When a device connects to a wireless network, special
04:19
unencrypted management packets are sent back and forth.
04:22
A deauthentication attack takes advantage of this
04:24
unencrypted process by sending fake, malicious
04:27
deauthentication packets to kick people off the network.
04:31
The attacker can select individual
04:32
users or kick everyone off at once.
04:35
Jamming and deauthentication attacks have the same
04:37
end result, but they use very different methods.<br>
04:41
Wi-Fi is used everywhere today and attackers are
04:43
always working on methods to exploit weaknesses.
04:46
Yet another wireless technology that can
04:47
be susceptible to attacks is Bluetooth.<br>
8. Bluetooth Attacks
04:50
From headphones and speakers to watches, fitness
04:52
devices, automobiles, and even refrigerators, Bluetooth
04:56
devices are heavily integrated into our daily lives.
04:59
This makes these devices attractive to malicious attackers.
05:02
An attacker can gather all sorts of personal data and even
05:05
take over our devices' embedded cameras and microphones.<br>
9. Bluejacking
05:09
One common Bluetooth attack is Bluejacking.
05:11
When performing a Bluejacking attack, he or
05:13
she looks for another Bluetooth device that's
05:15
discoverable and sends unwanted messages to it.
05:18
Attackers can't gain control of a device or steal any
05:21
data so Bluejacking is more annoying than harmful.<br>
10. Bluesnarfing
05:25
Bluesnarfing, on the other hand, can be harmful.
05:27
Bluesnarfing is when an attacker exploits a
05:29
vulnerability in the OBject EXchange Protocol,
05:32
or OBEX Protocol, to pair to a target device.
05:35
Once paired, he or she is able to access all the victim's
05:38
device data and then disconnect without leaving a trace.<br>
05:42
The best defense against both of these attacks
05:44
is to only enable Bluetooth when you need to
05:46
and to not leave devices in Discovery Mode.<br>
11. RFID Attacks
05:49
Radio frequency identification, or RFID, uses
05:52
radio waves to transmit data from small circuit
05:55
boards called RFID tags to special scanners.
05:58
Active RFID tags, like those seen in a car's toll pass, have
06:02
on-board batteries and can send signals over a long distance.
06:06
Passive RFID tags, which are used in ID
06:08
badges and credit cards, aren't powered.
06:11
These tags instead rely on the
06:13
RFID scanner's transferred energy.<br>
06:15
A malicious attacker can build their
06:17
own scanner to target these RFID tags.
06:19
If an attacker can get close enough,
06:21
they can scan the RFID chip and clone it.
06:24
An attacker might also eavesdrop on the communication
06:27
between the chip and reader and steal the data that way.<br>
06:30
To protect against these attacks, RFID chips often
06:33
operate at different frequencies, making it more
06:35
difficult for an attacker to quickly complete a scan.
06:38
Also, because most of these chips are passive, an
06:41
attacker has to get extremely close for it to work.
12. NFC Attacks
06:44
Near field communication, or NFC, is a
06:46
newer technology that's built on RFID.
06:49
NFC allows two-way communication between two devices.
06:52
But they must be within a few centimeters of each other.<br>
06:55
NFC is what allows us to use our
06:57
smartphones to pay for items at the store.
06:59
We can also use NFC to transfer files between
07:01
two phones if they're right next to each other.
07:04
NFC is vulnerable to the same types of attacks as RFID,
07:07
but it requires the attacker to be incredibly close.<br>
13. Summary
07:10
That'll wrap up this lesson.
07:12
In this lesson, we looked at some
07:13
different wireless communications attacks.
07:15
We first looked at Wi-Fi and rogue access points,
07:18
evil twin attacks, how an IV can be exploited, and
07:21
also how jamming and disassociation attacks work.
07:24
Then we looked at Bluetooth attacks,
07:25
including Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing.
07:28
Finally, we covered how RFID and NFC work and the
07:31
security concerns associated with both of these devices.<br>
