1. Web Application Attacks
00:03
Applications are used extensively in all devices,
00:06
including computers, servers, mobile devices, and more.
00:10
Oftentimes, these applications have access to
00:12
critical components of the operating system.
00:14
Attackers will target application vulnerabilities
00:17
to gain elevated privileges, crash the system,
00:20
access the network, steal sensitive data, and more.
00:23
In this lesson, we'll look at some of the common
00:25
vulnerabilities and attacks you need to be aware
00:27
of and some steps you can take to mitigate them.<br>
2. Privilege Escalation Attacks
00:31
When an attacker gains access to a system, one of their
00:33
first goals is to gain enough privileges to execute their own
00:37
code on the target system, known as arbitrary code execution.
00:41
There are two types of privilege escalation.<br>
00:44
The first is horizontal escalation, which happens
00:47
when the attacker accesses functionality or data
00:49
that belongs to another user with the same privilege
00:52
level they currently have, such as a co-worker.
00:54
This type of escalation is usually only focused
00:57
on gaining access to that particular account.<br>
01:00
Vertical escalation is the more common escalation type.
01:03
It occurs when the attacker gains access to an
01:05
account with a higher-level access than they
01:07
currently have, such as an administrator account.
01:11
Vigilant monitoring and proper implementation of access
01:13
control security measures, such as strong passwords and
01:16
implementing the principle of least privilege, will go a
01:19
long way in protecting against escalation attacks.<br>
3. Memory Injection Attack
01:23
Now, let's look at memory injection attacks.
01:25
These attacks occur when the attacker injects malicious
01:28
code into a running application's process memory.
01:31
One of the more common types is an overflow attack.
01:34
An overflow occurs when a program is designed
01:36
only to handle a certain amount of data, but the
01:39
attacker sends more data, which can cause the
01:41
system to crash or behave in unexpected ways.
01:44
The most common of these is the buffer stack
01:46
overflow, which targets the stack of a program.
01:49
To better understand this, let's look
01:51
at how programs are put together.<br>
01:54
Overflow attacks are one of the
01:55
most dangerous types of attacks.
01:57
The main cause of these attacks is errors in programming.
02:00
The best way to defend against these attacks is
02:02
to use proper programming practices and avoid
02:05
programming functions known to be vulnerable.
02:07
Thankfully, many modern languages, such as Python and
02:10
Java, have built-in controls to prevent overflow attacks.<br>
4. Replay Attack
02:15
A replay attack, also known as a session replay or
02:18
session hijack, exploits the session cookies that
02:21
are generated when you connect to a web application.
02:24
These cookies allow the application to identify
02:26
the user and prove that they've been authenticated.
02:29
The hacker can intercept the cookie using an
02:31
on-path attack and then forge their own cookie file
02:34
to establish a session with the web application.
02:36
This allows the attacker to gain access to the
02:38
victim's account without knowing their credentials.<br>
02:42
To prevent this form of attack, use a strong digital
02:45
signature with timestamps, session keys that are
02:47
time-bound and process-bound, and sequence numbers.
02:51
Authentication systems can be programmed to accept network
02:53
packets with valid timestamps and sequence numbers.<br>
5. Malicious Updates
02:57
The last attack we'll look at is the malicious update.
03:00
This occurs when a software program update
03:02
seems legitimate but contains malicious code.
03:05
This can happen when the software's website is hacked,
03:08
and the update file is replaced with the malicious one.
03:11
This type of attack is particularly devastating
03:13
because it not only harms the victims but can also
03:16
destroy the reputation of the software developer.
03:19
Malicious updates can be difficult to protect
03:21
against, but secure software supply chain management,
03:25
digital signature verification, and other software
03:27
security practices help mitigate these risks.<br>
6. Summary
03:31
That'll wrap up this lesson on web application attacks.
03:34
In this lesson, we reviewed some common attacks
03:36
you should be aware of, including escalation
03:38
attacks, memory injection attacks, replay
03:40
attacks, race conditions, and malicious updates.
03:44
We also looked at some security measures we can
03:46
take to help mitigate each of these attacks.<br>
