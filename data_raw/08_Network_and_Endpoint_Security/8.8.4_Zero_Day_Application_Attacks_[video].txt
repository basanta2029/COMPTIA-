1. Zero Day Application Attacks
00:04
Let's talk about the Zero-Day Attack.<br>
00:06
A zero-day attack is a threat that exploits a
00:08
vulnerability in a computer application that is still
00:10
unknown, or that has never been exploited before.
00:13
There are two primary vehicles used
00:15
to conduct these types of attacks.<br>
2. Attacks
00:17
The first one is a web browser.
00:19
Browsers are popular targets
00:21
because almost every system has one.<br>
00:22
The other type is sending zero-day exploits via email.
00:26
A zero-day email contains a link that
00:28
launches the attack if it's clicked.<br>
3. Unknown Vulnerability Management Process
00:30
A zero-day attack occurs during the window between the
00:32
time when the attacker first exploits the vulnerability
00:35
and when the software developer creates a fix for it.
00:37
This window may vary from a couple of days to many years.<br>
00:41
With this in mind, let's look at a process that many
00:43
software developers use to prevent zero-day attacks.
00:46
It is the Unknown Vulnerability Management Process <br>
00:49
The unknown vulnerability management process
00:52
is a quality assurance process that finds and
00:55
fixes unknown zero-day vulnerabilities.
00:57
It is composed of four phases:
00:58
analyze, test, report, and mitigate.<br>
4. Phases
01:03
During the Analyze phase, the developers are
01:06
trying to find the application's vulnerabilities.
01:08
They're looking for weaknesses and attack vectors,
01:11
which are ways an attacker can get into the application.
01:13
Here, the developers try to
01:15
break the application themselves.<br>
01:17
Next is the Test phase.
01:19
During this phase, what's called fuzz
01:21
testing conducted against the attack
01:23
vectors identified during the analysis phase.<br>
01:26
After testing comes the Report phase.
01:28
During the report phase, personnel try to reproduce any
01:32
issues found during the testing phase to make sure that the
01:35
situation is replicable and represents a real vulnerability.<br>
01:38
Next is the Mitigate phase.
01:40
This is where a fix is developed for the vulnerability,
01:43
based on the results of the testing and reporting phases.<br>
5. Defending Against Zero-day Attacks
01:46
What should Security Administrators
01:48
do to defend against zero-day attacks?
01:50
First is to configure automatic updates for
01:53
the operating system and the application.<br>
01:55
By configuring automatic updates to the operating
01:58
system, you are patching holes in the operating
02:00
system where the application is running.
02:02
The zero-day attacker is going to be looking
02:04
for an exploit unique to that application.
02:06
However, you want to close as
02:08
many attack vectors as you can.
02:09
Keeping your operating system updated will
02:12
make your system safer from attacks in general.<br>
02:14
You should also have a network firewall and a host firewall.
02:17
By using a host-based firewall, you're hardening
02:20
the system where the application is running, making
02:22
it more difficult for an exploit to take place.<br>
6. Use an IDS/IPS
02:24
Finally, you should use an IDS or an IPS.
02:29
For zero-day attacks, you are looking for anomalies.
02:31
Consequently, virus scanners or malware
02:34
detection applications probably won't
02:36
work because they're based on signatures.
02:38
There won't be a signature for an unknown exploit, and
02:41
the attack will slip by your malware detection software.<br>
02:43
By using an intrusion detection system or an intrusion
02:47
prevention system, you look for anomalies against the norm.
02:50
The IDS system will alert you that there is
02:53
something unusual going on with the system.
02:55
You can then begin troubleshooting, and you may
02:57
discover a potential zero-day attack occurring.<br>
7. Summary
02:59
In this video, we covered the basics
03:02
of zero-day attacks and what they are.
03:04
Then we looked at the methodology and procedures that
03:06
software developers use to find the unknown vulnerabilities.
03:09
Finally, we looked at a few things that you can
03:11
do on your end to defend against zero-day attacks.<br>
