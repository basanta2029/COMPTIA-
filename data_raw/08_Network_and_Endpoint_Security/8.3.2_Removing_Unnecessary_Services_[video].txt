1. View Linux Services
00:04
It's important to know many things about services:
00:06
how to start them, see if they're running, stop
00:08
them, restart them, enable them, and disable them.
00:12
For this demo, we're going to work with an Ubuntu
00:14
Linux system and practice working with some services.<br>
2. View Services in the init.d Directory
00:17
I'm already logged on to the
00:18
system, and I'll start the terminal.
00:19
I have a shortcut here, but you can also
00:22
go here, to Show Applications, and then
00:25
search for 'terminal' in the search box.<br>
00:27
I want to see the init.d directory.
00:30
We're interested in services that are running.
00:32
Let's go to the directory by typing 'cd /etc/init.d/'.
00:34
Press Enter.
00:39
Now I'll do an 'ls' to see what's in this directory.<br>
00:43
All right, here are my services.
00:46
Here, I have Apache server.
00:48
Here, I have mysql.
00:50
Over here, we have ssh.
00:52
And down here, there's FTP.
00:54
On this system, there's no reason to have
00:57
FTP running, so let's see how we can stop it.<br>
01:00
I'll type 'cd' to get back to root
01:03
and 'clear' to clean up my screen.<br>
3. Starting and Stopping FTP Services
01:05
So far, I've used init.d to view the services.
01:08
To manage the services, I'm going
01:10
to use the systemctl command.
01:11
Using init.d scripts to manage services
01:16
isn't possible on newer systems anymore, but
01:18
I still use it to view services sometimes.<br>
01:21
Let's look at my FTP server.
01:23
First, I want to see its status.
01:25
So, let's type 'sudo systemctl
01:26
status vsftpd' and press Enter.
01:34
It says it's enabled, but it's currently stopped.<br>
01:37
I'm going to use my up arrow to get to the last command,
01:41
change it from status to 'start', and press Enter.
01:44
Now I'll arrow up until I see status and press Enter again.<br>
01:48
I can see that it's running along with some
01:49
statistics, such as how long it's been up.
01:52
I can also see the process ID, or PID, right here.
01:55
Let's clear the screen.<br>
01:57
Now I'm going to use my up arrow
01:58
to go back to my last command.
02:00
I'm going to backspace here, get rid of the word
02:02
"start:", and type in 'stop' to stop the FTP service.<br>
02:07
I'll arrow up again until I get to status and press Enter.
02:10
Now you can see that the process has stopped.
02:12
I'll press Ctrl+C to exit this
02:14
command and then type 'clear'.<br>
02:17
Now I might say, oops, that's not what I wanted to do!
02:19
It's okay.
02:19
We'll just arrow up again until we get to start.
02:23
Press Enter, and everything's just fine again.<br>
02:26
What if I made changes to my FTP server,
02:28
and I need to restart the service?
02:30
I can just do a restart.
02:32
Let's up arrow to the last command, backspace
02:34
here, type in 'restart', and press Enter.
02:39
Arrow up to the last command,
02:40
backspace, and change this to 'status'.
02:45
Press Enter, and you can see my service restarted.
02:49
I'll clear the screen again.<br>
4. Enable and Disable FTP Services
02:51
So far, we've stopped and started our FTP service.
02:53
But what if I want to have it start at system startup?
02:57
Or, perhaps, not start when the system starts up?<br>
02:59
First, let's see if the service is enabled or not.
03:02
I can do that with the is-enabled command.
03:05
I'll arrow up to the last command
03:06
and change this part to 'is-enabled'.
03:09
Press Enter, and right here, it says that it's enabled.<br>
03:13
What if you want to have your service
03:14
start every time your system starts?
03:16
You can do that by changing this
03:17
to 'enable' and pressing Enter.
03:20
Now you can see the status is enabled.<br>
03:22
If I don't want the service to start, I'll
03:24
arrow up and change this to 'disable'.
03:27
Press Enter, and that'll tell this
03:29
system not to start FTP at startup.
03:31
I'll arrow up and change this to 'status', and
03:34
you can see that, up here, it says "disabled",
03:36
so when the system boots, FTP won't start.
03:39
Note that the service is still running at the moment
03:41
because all we did was keep it from running at startup;
03:44
we didn't stop it from running at this moment.<br>
5. Summary
03:46
That's it for this demo.
03:48
In this demo, we worked with system services.
03:51
First, we viewed the services to see what was on our system.
03:54
Then we practiced stopping, starting,
03:56
enabling, and disabling services.<br>
