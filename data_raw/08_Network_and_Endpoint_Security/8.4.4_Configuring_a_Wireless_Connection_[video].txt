Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.
1. Configure a Wireless Connection
00:04
Connecting to Wi-Fi is something pretty much
00:06
everyone does these days, but there are some
00:08
additional settings that many users are not aware of.
00:11
In this demonstration, we are going to go and see
00:13
where you can configure these additional settings.<br>
2. Connect to a Wireless from a Client
00:16
I have a PC that has a USB Wi-Fi adapter.
00:19
When click on the taskbar you can see
00:21
we are not connected to any networks.
00:24
Our Wi-Fi adapter is on however
00:26
its just not connected to anything.
00:28
When we click this arrow, we are shown the
00:30
available wireless networks around this area.<br>
00:33
To connect to a wireless network, I
00:35
find the SSID, which is right here.
00:37
I can click it once and I'm able to click Connect.
00:40
From here, I'm prompted for the passphrase.
00:43
We have that set up to be LearningIsCool.
00:46
I can then click here to verify that I
00:48
typed it in correctly and click Next.
00:54
Great were connected and ready to go.<br>
3. View Wireless Profiles
00:57
Let's look at our wireless profiles.
00:59
To see these, we need to go to <b>Start </b>&gt;<b>Settings</b>&gt;
01:05
<b>Network &amp; Internet</b>&gt;<b>Wi-Fi</b>&gt;
01:07
<b>Manage Known Networks</b>.
01:10
Once you successfully connect to a wireless, the computer
01:13
creates what's called a profile.<br>
01:15
The profile identifies wireless networks that have been connected
01:18
to it in the past. These profiles are saved so you can
01:21
connect to the same network again later.<br>
01:24
Click on the profile to change
01:25
its properties about the connection.<br>
01:27
The first thing I can do is tell this to
01:29
connect automatically to this wireless.
01:32
If it's one that you want to use as your default,
01:34
you might want to have this turned to On.<br>
01:37
If you pay for bandwidth, you might want to tell
01:39
this connection that you're on a metered connection.
01:41
This will help prevent things such as Windows
01:43
Update from downloading large files while connected.
01:46
This is nice because you can then avoid
01:48
charges for data you didn't plan on using.
01:51
Let's click up here and go back.<br>
4. Add a Wireless Network Manually
01:52
You might want to add a wireless network profile manually.
01:56
This might be if you're connecting to a
01:58
wireless network and there is no SSID broadcast.<br>
02:01
To do this, we select Add a new network.
02:04
We can then enter our network name here.
02:06
I'll put in Testout_Hidden and for Security
02:10
type, I'll select WPA2-Personal from the list.
02:14
I need to enter a security key which
02:15
will be the same LearningIsCool.
02:19
I then have the option to connect automatically and
02:21
also to connect even if this network isn't broadcasting.
02:25
I'll click Save here at the bottom,
02:27
and we've added a network manually.
02:29
Since were already connected to an existing
02:31
network we will have to go back down to your Wi-Fi
02:34
connected and click connect on the Testout_Hidden.
02:38
Once doing so it will connect to this network now.
02:41
Keep note you may only want to update what Wi-Fi
02:44
networks you want to connect to automatically if
02:46
there are many around the same location.<br>
5. Remove a Wireless Network
02:49
To remove a network you no longer want, you select
02:52
the Wi-Fi connection that you want to remove and
02:54
Right Click to select the Forget option.
03:00
This doesn't show you a confirmation dialog, so
03:03
pay attention and make sure you're removing the right one.
03:07
This can also be done in the Manage known networks.<br>
6. Mobile Hotspot
03:10
Mobile Hotspot is a feature that allows
03:12
you to create a hotspot on your computer.
03:15
Instead of you connecting to a hotspot
03:17
you are making this computer the hotspot.
03:20
An example could be having one computer plugged into
03:22
a wired internet connection and then the same computer
03:26
provided wireless to share the internet connection.
03:29
Not only can it make a hotspot off a wired
03:31
connection it can reshare a wireless connection too.
03:36
In our task bar there is a quick
03:37
option to turn on mobile hotspot.
03:40
After clicking on it our mobile hotspot will be active.
03:43
In order to see more settings for this we
03:45
must go to or Network&amp; internet settings.
03:48
Were already in our settings so we
03:50
will take a look at it from here.
03:52
The setting were looking for is Mobile hotspot.
03:56
The settings here provide key information
03:58
such as the password for this Mobile hotspot.
04:01
If we select edit were able to change
04:03
the Network name and password if need be.
04:06
If you're on your battery this setting here for Power saving
04:09
will be helpful because it will automatically shut Mobile
04:12
hotspot off once it notices no devices are connecting to it.
04:15
The last thing I would like to point out is this
04:18
hotspot is only limited to 8 devices so if you have more
04:22
devices then that then this setup will not work for you.<br>
7. View Wireless adapter features
04:26
A lot of the available features for a wireless adapter are
04:28
still available however it may be hidden for the public eye.
04:32
A regular user may not be concerned about them, but we are.
04:36
Open the search and type cmd.
04:39
This will bring up the option to open the command prompt.
04:42
In our command prompt let's type in
04:43
"netsh wlan show wirelesscapabilities".
04:52
Press enter.
04:53
This list will show us what is supported
04:55
by the wireless adapter and what is not.
04:58
For example, ANQP Service Information Discovery was the
05:01
previous option listed in windows 10 for hotspot 2.0.
05:06
its not listed in our settings on this Windows install
05:08
however its still supported by the wireless adapter.<br>
8. Summary
05:12
That's it for this demo.
05:14
In this demo, we looked at how to
05:15
connect to a wireless network in Windows.
05:18
We then looked at Mobile hotspot and
05:20
supported capabilities of a wireless adapter.<br>
