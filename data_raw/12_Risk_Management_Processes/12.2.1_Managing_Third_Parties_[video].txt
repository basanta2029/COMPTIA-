1. Manage Third Parties
00:04
It's common for one organization to work
00:06
directly with a third party in a vendor, supply
00:09
chain, or business partner relationship.
00:11
These relationships often require the both parties'
00:14
information systems to connect and integrate.
00:17
Doing this exposes both network to risks.
00:20
You'll want to pay careful attention to the onboarding
00:22
phase, the ongoing operations phase, and the
00:25
offboarding phase of this third-party relationship.
2. Onboarding Phase
00:27
Let's take a look at the onboarding phase first.
00:31
During this phase of the relationship, you'll want to sit
00:34
down with individuals from the third-party organization.
00:37
Compare each of your organization's
00:39
security policies and infrastructure.
00:41
Are the security policies for each organization similar?
00:45
If there are substantial
00:46
differences, you should discuss them.
00:48
Do both organizations have similar
00:50
incident response procedures?
00:52
If there are differences, how will
00:53
each party handle incident response?
00:55
Are the security controls similar?
00:58
Are the audit policies similar?
01:00
Is the security posture of each organization compatible
01:03
enough to work together, or will the integration expose
01:07
vulnerabilities in one or both organizations?
01:10
Finding answers to these questions helps you to identify
01:13
and evaluate differences and potential risks up front.
01:17
There will always be risks, so you'll need to work with
01:19
your organization's leadership to determine if the risks
01:22
of this potential relationship outweigh the benefits.
01:25
If so, it's okay to walk away.
01:28
But if the benefits outweigh the risks, you'll
01:30
want to move forward with the relationship.
01:33
After that decision is made, you need
01:34
to create an interoperability agreement.
01:38
This agreement is a collection of documents that
01:39
identifies the key responsibilities in the relationship.
01:43
The documents will specify who is going to perform
01:46
key tasks, how those tasks will be measured, and how
01:49
decisions will be handled, and other such information.
3. Service Level Agreement
01:53
The first interoperability agreement document
01:55
you need is a Service Level Agreement, or SLA.
01:58
An SLA states what each organization in
02:02
the relationship will do and at what level.
02:05
It may also define how disputes will be managed, provide
02:08
warranties, specify disaster recovery procedures, and
02:12
specify when the agreement will be terminated.
4. Memorandum of Understanding
02:15
Second, we need a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU.
02:17
An MOU provides a brief summary of the relationship.
02:22
It describes which party is responsible
02:24
for performing specific tasks .
02:27
Basically, it says who is going to
02:28
do what, and when they'll do it.
5. Business Partnership Agreement
02:30
Next, we'll need a Business Partnership Agreement, or BPA.
02:33
A BPA explains the rules surrounding
02:36
the finances of the partnership.
02:38
This could include details on how to handle
02:41
contributions, withdrawals, financial reporting,
02:44
and the profit and loss distribution.
6. Interconnection Security Agreement
02:47
Another important document is the
02:48
Interconnection Security Agreement, or ISA.
02:51
The ISA documents how the information
02:54
systems of both organizations will connect
02:56
and how they're going to share data.
02:57
The ISA is more technical in nature.
03:01
The SLA and the MOU define the relationship,
03:04
whereas the BPA and the ISA specify how the
03:08
project work is going to take place.
7. Ongoing Operations Phase
03:09
When onboarding is complete, you can start conducting
03:12
business according to the terms of the agreement.
03:15
During the ongoing operations phase, you'll
03:18
want to keep any eye on several things.
03:20
First, regularly verify compliance with
03:23
the interoperability agreement documents.
03:26
Make sure that each organization
03:28
is doing what it said it would do.
03:30
In addition, conduct periodic vulnerability assessments
03:33
to verify that the shared network connections have not
03:36
exposed or created some type of security weakness.
03:40
You should also conduct regular security audits to
03:42
ensure that organizations are following the security
03:45
requirements contained in the interoperability agreement.
03:49
Communication between the organizations is critical.
03:52
Share the vulnerability assessment and security
03:54
audit findings with everyone involved in the
03:56
relationship in order to maintain risk awareness.
8. Offboarding Phase
04:00
When the operations phase is complete and you've reached the
04:03
end of your agreement, you're ready to end the relationship.
04:06
This process is called offboarding.
04:09
Although this is an important phase,
04:10
it's probably the most neglected.
04:13
During offboarding, you want to ensure that all the security
04:15
doors you opened to facilitate the relationship are closed.
9. Offboarding Phase
04:19
From a technical standpoint, you'll want to
04:21
reset or disable any open or shared connections
04:24
that you may have with the third party.
04:27
This could include VPNs, firewalls, or routers and switches
04:30
that were set up to share information from your network.
04:34
In addition, disable any domain trust relationships
04:37
established between the organizations.
04:39
Disable any user or group accounts used by third
04:42
parties to access your organization's data.
04:45
Finally, reset passwords used by the third
04:47
party to access applications on your network.
04:50
Leaving any of these doors open could potentially
04:53
expose the information on your network.
04:55
During the offboarding process, you'll also want to
04:56
revisit the NDA, and you'll want to put all of your
05:00
end-of-business agreements into a written format.
10. Summary
05:04
That's it for this lesson.
05:05
In this video, we talked about managing third parties.
05:08
We looked at the onboarding phase and
05:10
the various documents commonly used.
05:12
We talked about the ongoing operations phase of
05:14
the relationship, and we discussed considerations
05:17
for the offboarding phase to ensure that access
05:19
to your system ends with the relationship.
