1. Windows Security Log Audit
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll show you how to audit the
00:07
Windows Security log, allowing you to audit security-related
00:10
events on one host or across your entire Windows network.<br>
2. Audit Methods
00:15
There are two methods for auditing:<br>
00:16
You can audit individual workstations
00:18
using the local security policy.
00:20
However, this method can be time-intensive and
00:23
challenging to manage when auditing more than a few hosts.<br>
00:28
Alternatively, you can use Group Policy, which we'll opt
00:30
for as it's associated with the entire Windows domain.
00:34
This is the method we'll demonstrate,
00:35
as it's a more efficient solution.
00:37
When a domain user logs in at a workstation,
00:40
the audit settings for the Windows Security
00:42
log will be applied to that workstation.<br>
00:45
Let's open Group Policy Management.<br>
3. Group Policy Management
00:49
This is our default domain, and here
00:51
we have the Default Domain policy.<br>
00:53
We'll right-click and go to Edit.
00:56
Now, we have a Group Policy
00:57
Management Editor, which we'll expand.<br>
00:59
We'll navigate to Computer Configuration,
01:02
Policies, Windows Settings, Security
01:06
Settings, Local Policies, and Audit Policy.<br>
01:10
On the right pane, you'll see
01:11
audit policies, a total of nine.<br>
01:14
For instance, if we explore Audit Account
01:16
Management, we can specify auditing the management
01:18
of user and group accounts, or we can audit
01:21
directory service access and various other events.<br>
01:25
Object Access allows us to audit access to files,
01:28
folders, printers, registry keys, and more.<br>
01:32
We also have Audit Policy Change, which audits changes made
01:35
to local policies, including user rights or security options.<br>
01:40
Audit Privilege Use lets us audit
01:42
the use of user rights or privileges.<br>
01:45
Audit Process Tracking, primarily used by
01:47
application developers, tracks detailed program
01:50
information for events like program activation,
01:53
process, exit, handle duplication, etc.
01:56
It's resource-intensive, so use it sparingly.<br>
02:00
Lastly, we have Audit System Events,
02:02
which logs system events such as server
02:04
reboots, providing valuable information.<br>
4. Account Logon and Audit Logon Events
02:07
Among the more useful audits from a security perspective
02:10
are Audit Account Logon and Audit Logon Events.
02:14
By default, these policies are undefined.
02:17
Let's configure some Audit Logon Event policy settings.<br>
02:20
Let's open this up.
02:21
We can audit for both success and failure,
02:24
depending on your preferences and security needs.<br>
02:27
For example, auditing failed logon attempts
02:29
can help identify potential security threats
02:32
like password guessing attacks.
02:34
On the other hand, auditing successful logins can
02:37
be useful when investigating unauthorized access.<br>
02:40
For our demonstration, we'll audit logon failure
02:43
events by selecting Failure and deselecting Success.<br>
02:48
Now, let's close the Group Policy Management Editor.
02:51
The Default Domain policy is linked to the domain.
02:54
To apply these settings, we need to generate some failed
02:57
logon attempts and analyze them using Event Viewer.<br>
03:01
We've restarted this machine to
03:02
update the Group Policy settings.<br>
03:05
Instead of rebooting, you can also use the Search
03:07
box and type "GPupdate" to update Group Policy.<br>
03:15
Before logging back in, we intentionally
03:17
created some failed password attempts.
03:20
Let's examine the results.<br>
03:24
In Event Viewer, right-click and run as an
03:27
administrator, expand Windows logs, and go to Security.<br>
03:32
We can see that our policy in the Default
03:34
Domain has generated several audit
03:36
failures due to the failed logon attempts.
03:40
We can view details such as the account name
03:42
that attempted to log in with a bad password.<br>
03:45
By navigating through the logs, we
03:46
can inspect these failed attempts.
03:48
Now, let's close this window.<br>
5. Granular Auditing
03:51
Before concluding this demonstration,
03:53
let's explore one more feature.<br>
03:56
Under Group Policy Management, we'll return to the
03:58
Default Domain, Edit, Group Policy Management Editor,
04:02
and go to Computer Configuration, Windows settings.<br>
04:06
We'll expand and go to Security Settings,
04:08
Local Policies, and Audit Policies.<br>
04:11
While the basic audit policies offer settings for
04:14
broader behaviors, advanced audit policies allow for more
04:18
granular control over auditing specific security events.<br>
04:22
For instance, we can configure audit
04:24
policies for logon or logoff events.
04:27
Under Security Settings, Advanced Audit
04:30
Policy Configuration, and Audit Policies,
04:33
we can target more specific audit events.<br>
04:36
Let's take Account Logon as an example.
04:39
We can audit both success and failure of logon events.<br>
04:43
With the earlier audit settings, a single logon failure
04:46
generated multiple messages in the Windows Security Log.
04:50
By selecting specific audit options here, we can
04:53
significantly reduce the volume of information
04:55
generated, making it more manageable.<br>
04:58
These advanced audit policies also allow auditing
05:01
for specific events like account lockouts, which
05:04
isn't possible with the earlier policies.<br>
6. Summary
05:07
In summary, that's it for this demo.
05:09
We discussed setting up auditing, configured logon
05:11
auditing, generated and examined failed logon events in
05:15
Event Viewer, and delved into the Advanced Audit Policy
05:19
Configuration for more granular security event auditing.<br>
