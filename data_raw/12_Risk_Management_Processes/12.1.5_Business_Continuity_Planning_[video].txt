1. Business Continuity Planning
00:04
In this video, we're going to
00:06
discuss business continuity planning.
00:07
Natural disasters can cause catastrophic failures
00:10
or extended disruptions--anything from a lightning
00:13
strike that fries a few hardware components to an
00:15
earthquake that destroys the entire building.
00:18
Business continuity planning is the creation and
00:20
validation of a plan for recovering and restoring
00:22
an organization's mission-critical functions after
00:25
a catastrophic disaster or extended disruption.
2. Business Impact Analysis
00:28
One important component of a business continuity
00:31
plan is a business impact analysis, or BIA.
00:33
A BIA focuses on the impact that
00:36
losses will have on the organization.
00:38
In a BIA, you identify critical functions--the operational
00:42
functions that are necessary to conduct your business.
00:45
Then you prioritize those critical business
00:47
functions, calculate a timeframe for recovering
00:49
them after a disaster, and estimate the tangible
00:52
and intangible impact on the organization.
3. RTO
00:56
When you're creating this plan, you'll
00:57
want to consider several parameters.
00:59
The first is the recovery time objective, or RTO.
01:02
The RTO states how much down time
01:05
your organization can tolerate.
01:07
It's another way of asking how long it'll take to get your
01:09
system back up and running in the event of a disaster.
01:12
Some data protection solutions have a very
01:14
short recovery time and can bring your network
01:16
back into operation relatively quickly.
01:19
Others have a long RTO that lasts several days.
4. RPO
01:22
The second parameter is the recover point objective, or RPO.
01:25
The RPO tells you two things.
01:28
The first is the maximum length of
01:30
time you can tolerate between backups.
01:32
How old can restored data be?
01:34
For example, if you run backups nightly, the maximum
01:37
age of your data would be 24 hours because there would
01:38
be a 24-hour window when no backups were taking place.
01:43
If your organization only backs up data once a week,
01:46
the maximum age of your data could be seven days.
01:49
The longer the time between your
01:50
backups, the older the data will be.
01:52
In an extreme example, if you back up once a week on
01:56
Sunday and have a catastrophic failure on Friday, all
01:59
the work done for five or six days would be lost.
02:02
Most organizations can't tolerate that.
02:05
But if you run your backups once a
02:06
day, the maximum age becomes 24 hours.
02:09
That sounds much better than five or six days, right?
02:11
The second thing RPO specifies is the
02:15
number of backups from which to choose.
02:17
Some disaster recovery solutions provide one backup.
02:20
Other solutions may have multiple
02:21
recovery points to select from.
02:23
This depends on the data protection
02:25
itself and how you've configured it.
5. MTTR
02:27
Another thing to consider during your business
02:29
impact analysis is the mean time to repair.
02:31
MTTR identifies the average amount of time needed to
02:35
repair a failed component or to restore operations.
02:39
If you provide system access to other organizations,
02:41
your service level agreement may specify how quickly
02:44
you guarantee a fully functional and accessible system.
6. MTBF
02:48
Similarly, the mean time between failures, or MTBF,
02:52
identifies the average lifetime of a system or component--how
02:55
long before the system wears out from age or use.
02:58
Components should be replaced
02:59
about the time the MTBF is reached.
7. Site Resiliency
03:02
In the event of a tornado, fire, or hurricane,
03:05
your building will probably be unusable.
03:08
Implementing site resiliency – having an alternate
03:11
location where you can pick up business where you left
03:12
off – could be extremely beneficial to your organization.
03:16
There are three categories of site resiliency:
03:18
hot sites, warm sites, and cold sites.
8. Hot Site
03:21
A hot site, or active backup model, is an alternate
03:24
location that facilitates a fast and full recovery.
03:27
This is, by far, the most effective backup option.
03:31
It's also the most costly.
03:32
In order to be fully operational within
03:34
minutes, you need to have an alternate location.
03:37
All servers, devices, cabling, and infrastructure
03:39
need to be installed and ready to go.
03:42
Hot sites often have a live connection to your main
03:44
site with data copied across to the duplicate servers.
03:47
This is called mirroring.
03:49
If the active site fails, the hot site is fully operation
03:52
immediately, with all the current data on the servers.
03:56
This transition can occur within minutes
03:57
or hours, so the downtime is minimal.
9. Warm Site
04:00
A warm site is partially configured.
04:02
You have an alternate location.
04:04
Some servers, some devices, some cabling, and some
04:06
infrastructure is installed, but not everything.
04:09
Data backups are available, but they aren't mirrored.
04:12
Some recovery from backup tapes, the cloud,
04:14
or other backup locations may be needed.
04:16
This transition could occur within hours or
04:18
days, so the downtime would be noticeable.
04:21
A warm site could be shared with
04:22
another organization to lower its cost.
04:25
This can be a good idea.
04:27
Just make sure that the companies are in different areas
04:29
so a natural disaster can't take them out at the same time.
10. Cold Site
04:32
Finally, there's a cold site.
04:34
You do have an alternate location, but
04:36
all equipment would need to be installed,
04:37
and all data would need to be recovered.
04:40
Downtime could extend for several weeks or even months.
04:43
No matter what type of site you decide to use, be sure to
04:46
thoroughly document what you have and what you will need
04:48
at the alternate location in the event of a disaster.
11. Summary
04:51
That's it for this lesson.
04:53
In this video, we discussed business continuity
04:55
plans, business impact analysis, and site resiliency,
04:58
including hot, warm, and cold site architecture.
