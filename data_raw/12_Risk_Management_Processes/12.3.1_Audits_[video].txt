1. Internal and External
00:04
Audits and assessments are crucial to maintaining
00:07
trustworthy relationships and business operations.
00:09
Audits involve evaluating an organization's
00:12
processes, controls, and compliance, whereas an
00:15
assessment evaluates operations such as cybersecurity,
00:18
risk management, and internal controls.
00:21
In this lesson, we'll look at the difference
00:23
between internal and external assessments.
00:26
We'll also look at penetration testing, one of the
00:28
more common assessments that need to be performed.<br>
00:32
When an audit or assessment is done, it'll be
00:34
classified as either an internal or external assessment.
00:38
An internal audit is performed by the
00:39
organization's employees to provide an in-depth
00:42
analysis of the organization's business processes.
00:45
These internal audits should be performed on a regular basis
00:49
and focus on the needs and priorities of the organization.<br>
00:52
External audits, on the other hand, are
00:54
performed by an independent third party.
00:57
An external audit ensures that the organization's
00:59
practices meet industry standards and identifies
01:02
any areas the internal audit might have missed.<br>
01:05
Performing internal and external audits and assessments
01:09
provides a full accounting of the organization's
01:11
policies and procedures and allows the organization to
01:14
quickly identify and fix any shortcomings.
01:17
Performing these audits and assessments fosters transparency
01:20
and accountability and builds trust among stakeholders.
01:24
One of the more common assessments that should be
01:26
performed on a regular basis is a penetration test.<br>
2. Penetration Testing
01:30
Penetration testing, also called pen testing or ethical
01:33
hacking, involves hacking into a network to discover any
01:36
vulnerabilities and weaknesses so they can be remediated
01:39
before they're exploited by a malicious hacker.
01:42
The penetration test utilizes the same techniques that
01:45
a hacker would use, but the pen tester has written
01:48
permission to perform the audit, and the scope of the
01:50
test is clearly defined before anything is done.<br>
01:54
A penetration test will typically consist of five steps.
01:57
These include reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability
02:00
assessment, exploitation, and reporting.
02:04
In the reconnaissance phase, the pen tester
02:06
begins gathering information about their target.
02:09
This can include gathering publicly available information,
02:12
using social engineering techniques, and dumpster diving.<br>
02:15
The second step is scanning the target.
02:18
At this point, the tester is
02:19
actively engaged with the target.
02:21
Various tools are used to gather in-depth information about
02:24
the network, such as live hosts, open ports, and more.<br>
02:28
During the vulnerability assessment phase, the
02:30
pen tester takes all the information they've
02:33
gathered so far and identifies all potential
02:35
vulnerabilities that may exist on the network.
02:38
The pen tester then moves into the next phase and
02:41
attempts to exploit the confirmed vulnerabilities.<br>
02:44
The final step, reporting, involves compiling a detailed
02:47
analysis of the organization's security systems.
02:50
This includes all discovered vulnerabilities
02:52
that were exploited, along with recommendations
02:55
to remediate the vulnerabilities.<br>
02:57
When defining the rules of the penetration test, the
03:00
first step is to determine whether an unknown, partially
03:03
known, or known test environment will be used.
03:06
Let's look at the difference in each of these.<br>
03:09
An unknown test is when an ethical hacker has
03:11
no information about the target or network.
03:14
This test is the best for simulating an
03:16
outside attack and ignores insider threats.
03:20
The major drawback to this type of test is that
03:22
it takes more time and is much more expensive,
03:25
mostly because a lot of time and resources must
03:27
go into the reconnaissance and scanning phases.<br>
03:31
A known test is the opposite of an unknown test.
03:34
The pen tester is given full knowledge of the
03:36
network, computer systems, and infrastructure.
03:38
The known test environment allows a comprehensive
03:41
and thorough test of the organization's security.
03:44
Still, it's not very realistic, as an attacker will
03:47
rarely have all the information handed over to them.<br>
03:51
The partially known testing environment
03:52
simulates an insider threat.
03:54
The tester is given partial information
03:57
about the network and computer systems.
03:59
This can be IP configurations, email lists, computer names,
04:03
or other information an insider would realistically have.
04:07
This type of test requires less reconnaissance and scanning
04:10
but doesn't give all the information to the pen tester.<br>
04:14
Aside from testing network security, physical
04:16
penetration testing should also be performed.
04:19
In this type of test, the penetration tester attempts
04:22
to gain access to restricted areas, sensitive
04:25
information, or critical assets within the organization
04:28
using techniques like social engineering, tailgating,
04:31
lock picking, bypassing alarms or surveillance systems,
04:35
and exploiting physical vulnerabilities.<br>
04:38
Red team and blue team are other terms you'll run across.
04:41
In the cybersecurity field, an offensive
04:43
security team is called a red team, and a
04:45
defensive security team is called a blue team.
04:49
As the red team attempts to break into a
04:51
system, the blue team works to keep them out.<br>
3. Summary
04:54
That'll wrap up this lesson on audits and assessments.
04:57
In this lesson, we first looked at the benefits
04:59
of performing audits and assessments and the
05:01
difference between internal and external audits.
05:04
We then went over penetration testing, including
05:07
the steps involved and the different types of
05:09
penetration tests that can be performed.<br>
