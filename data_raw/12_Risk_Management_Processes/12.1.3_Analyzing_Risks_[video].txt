1. Analyze Risks
00:04
In this lesson, we're going to discuss risk analysis.
00:06
Risk analysis is the practice of determining
00:09
which identified threats are most pressing to an
00:11
organization and then attaching a potential cost
00:14
that can be expected if that threat occurs.
2. Calculate Risk
00:16
There are two general methods for
00:18
analyzing and calculating risk.
00:20
Quantitative analysis assigns real numbers
00:22
to the costs of damages and countermeasures.
00:25
It also assigns concrete probability
00:27
percentages to risk occurrence.
00:29
Qualitative analysis uses scenarios
00:31
to identify risks and responses.
00:34
Qualitative analysis is the more subjective of the two.
00:37
When calculating quantitatively, you want
00:39
to consider a risk's impact and likelihood.
00:41
What kind of damage can be done, and
00:43
what's the chance of it actually happening?
00:45
To determine the likelihood of a loss, you might
00:47
want to use an annualized rate of occurrence, or ARO.
00:51
An ARO is a collection of data gathered from historical
00:54
records such as crime statistics, natural disasters,
00:57
insurance payouts, and cyber incidence records.
01:00
To determine a loss's impact, you want to consider all
01:03
associated costs if an unfortunate scenario were to occur.
01:06
What would it cost to pay employees during the downtime?
01:09
What would it cost to replace the
01:10
impacted hardware or software?
01:12
Would there be refunds or other
01:13
costs associated with user retention?
01:16
Single loss expectancy, or SLE, is the amount of
01:19
loss expected for any single successful asset attack.
01:23
This is a monetary value that describes how much
01:25
the incident will cost in terms of lost asset value.
01:29
Annual loss expectancy, or ALE, estimates
01:32
the annual loss resulting from an incident.
01:34
You calculate ALE by multiplying your SLE by your ARO.
01:39
This tells you how much potential threats cost each year.
01:43
For example, if your asset loses $1,000 for each
01:46
incident, and you expect an incident every four years,
01:49
the annual cost for that asset would be $250.00.
3. Risk Illustration
01:54
Having a visual representation of risks can
01:55
help stakeholders make better assessments.
01:58
A risk register provides details of each known
02:01
risk, including a risk's category, description,
02:04
unique identification number, projected impact,
02:06
likelihood of occurrence, and risk response plan.
02:10
For better visualization, you could use this information
02:13
to create a scatter plot that represents each risk's
02:16
possible impact in relation to its overall probability.
02:19
A risk matrix, which is also known as a heat
02:22
map, illustrates a loss's likelihood and impact.
02:25
Notice that the colors in this
02:26
example range from cool to hot.
02:29
If an occurrence's possibility is rare and
02:31
its impact moderate, it gets a low rating.
02:34
If its likelihood is high, but the impact is
02:36
insignificant, it might end up with a medium rating.
02:39
And if the impact is severe and the likelihood
02:41
almost certain, it might receive an extreme rating.
4. Summary
02:45
That's it for this lesson.
02:47
In this lesson, we discussed risk analysis.
02:49
We looked at calculating risks quantitatively
02:52
and qualitatively, and we discussed a few ways
02:54
to illustrate our findings.
