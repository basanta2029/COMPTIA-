1. Risk Types and Tolerance
00:05
Risk management is the process of identifying
00:08
vulnerabilities and threats, and then deciding on
00:10
countermeasures to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
00:14
In other words, risk management is when a person or
00:16
group considers worst-case scenarios and determines just
00:19
how bad those scenarios would be for their organization.
00:22
Senior management is ultimately responsible
00:24
for residual risk, which is what remains
00:26
after taking risk-reduction measures.<br>
00:29
This all might sound kind of depressing.
00:31
But it's actually pretty liberating because
00:33
you can feel secure knowing that you've
00:34
thought through all possible problems.
00:36
It's kind of like insurance.
00:38
No one wants bad stuff to happen, but you invest in
00:40
an insurance policy so that you can have peace of
00:42
mind that if something does happen, you'll be ready.<br>
2. Asset Identification
00:46
The first step in risk management is to identify your
00:48
organization's assets and how much each asset is worth.
00:52
You want to pay special attention to assets
00:54
that are critical for your business to function.
00:56
You should place values on all assets,
00:58
including the cost of lost data, failed
01:00
systems, downtime, and training new employees.<br>
01:04
Assets include physical items like
01:06
computers and storage devices.
01:08
These items are usually purchased, and so
01:10
it's fairly easy to place a value on them.
01:11
But it becomes a bit harder to place a
01:13
value on an intangible asset like computer
01:16
data or a seasoned employee's knowledge.
01:18
While a computer can be easily replaced, the data
01:20
itself is possibly far more valuable in the end.
01:23
It's difficult to assign values to things
01:26
like that, but it's important to attempt to.<br>
3. Risk Identification
01:30
After you've identified your assets, you
01:31
should then identify possible asset
01:33
threats, which can be internal or external.
01:36
Internal threats come from within your organization
01:38
and could include employee fraud, theft, system
01:41
failure, sabotage, espionage, collusion, or snooping.<br>
01:45
External threats are things like fire,
01:47
water damage, burglars, internet attacks,
01:50
market competition, or natural disasters.<br>
4. Risk Analysis
01:53
Let's talk about risk analysis.
01:55
Risk analysis is the practice of
01:57
assessing which risks you've identified to
01:59
be the most relevant to the organization.
02:01
This is a key part of the risk management process.
02:04
Risk assessment determines quantitative and qualitative
02:07
risk values as they relate to a particular threat.
02:10
As a best practice, we try to create risk assessments
02:12
using quantitative measurements, which require us to
02:16
assign a number value to each identified risk.<br>
5. Risk Evaluation
02:19
You should also evaluate your risks.
02:21
This means determining if and when action
02:23
should be taken in a worst-cast scenario.
02:25
You would use this during the analysis
02:28
phase to determine each risk's tolerability.<br>
6. Risk Management Strategies
02:30
Finally, once all risks have been identified and assessed,
02:34
their management falls into one of four categories:
02:36
avoidance, transference, mitigation, and acceptance.
02:40
Avoidance is the decision to avoid the risk altogether.
02:44
In other words, you choose not to engage in
02:46
an activity because the risk is too high.<br>
02:48
Transference involves transferring the risk to someone else.
02:52
Many organizations have opted to outsource their
02:54
networking, security, and storage solutions.
02:56
Doing so helps to transfer a bit of the risk to
02:58
companies that are better prepared for potential threats.
03:01
As businesses dependence on technology
03:04
continues to grow, so does their cyber risk.
03:07
Another way businesses help prepare for a potentially
03:09
catastrophic loss is to take out cybersecurity insurance.
03:13
As with most insurance policies, this
03:15
protects against events that would have a
03:17
big financial impact should they occur.<br>
03:18
Mitigation is also an option.
03:21
You could reduce a potential threat's risk by
03:23
deploying security controls or other protections.
03:26
An administrative control is an actionable
03:27
procedure that should be followed to reduce risk.
03:30
A technical control is a device
03:32
that's used for this very purpose.
03:34
For example, you could configure system redundancy so
03:37
that if the original system were to go down, the redundant
03:40
system could take over and continue providing services.
03:43
Organizations should perform regular
03:45
risk-control assessments to ensure that
03:46
these controls continue to be effective.<br>
03:49
Sometimes, organizations opt to accept a risk
03:52
because the associated cost is acceptable, or
03:55
the cost to protect the asset is just too high.
03:56
A risk appetite statement, put simply, is
04:00
the amount of risk an organization is willing
04:02
to tolerate in order to reach its objectives.
04:05
If you do decide to accept a risk, it's important to
04:07
build response policies around a plausible outcome.
04:11
Know that in some instances, there might
04:13
actually be regulations that outline how
04:15
certain risks must be lawfully handled.
04:17
In these cases, you want to show that you took
04:20
all the necessary steps to safeguard against loss.
04:22
So make sure to study up and consider
04:25
the guidance of legal counsel.<br>
7. Summary
04:26
That's it for this lesson.
04:28
In summary, the risk management process is the process
04:31
for identifying threats and deciding which
04:33
countermeasures to take to reduce an undesirable outcome.
04:37
Asset and risk identification as well as risk
04:40
analysis, evaluation, and management strategies
04:43
all make up the risk management process.<br>
