1. Auditing Device Logs
00:03
In this demo, we'll discuss auditing device logs.
00:06
and we'll use our Cisco managed switch as an example.
00:09
Now, auditing device logs requires two things:
00:11
First, we must enable logging so that we have log
00:14
events that are being captured on the device.
00:16
And second, we take the time to review or
00:19
audit the logs to see what's happening.
00:21
Let's see how this is done.
2. Log Settings
00:23
First, let's enable logging by clicking
00:24
Administration, System Log, then Log Settings.
00:29
You'll see that logging is currently enabled.
00:31
This particular device has three types of logging.
00:34
You can save log events in RAM, the random-access
00:36
memory which will be lost after the system reboots.
00:40
You can also save log events in flash memory which
00:42
means that they'll be stored after the system reboots.
00:45
And, finally, you can also aggregate, or compile,
00:48
your logs and send them to a SYS log server.
3. Event Aggregation
00:51
To enable event aggregation, we enable the Syslog
00:54
aggregator by checking the box and entering a time
00:57
in seconds for Max Aggregation Time.
01:00
Will enter 300 here, which will mean 5 minutes.
01:03
If you have a set of events that happen
01:05
repeatedly—"for example, the same event keeps
01:07
happening every five seconds—"what will happen is the
01:11
aggregator will say this event happened 15 times.
01:13
Instead of seeing a separate entry for each similar
01:15
event, you'll see the event happened and the number
01:18
of times it happened within that aggregation period.
01:22
We'll click apply to enable logging with aggregation.
4. Remote Log Servers
01:25
You can add a remote log server, so you
01:27
can view your logs from a central location.
01:30
We'll click add and here you can specify the
01:33
server by IP address or name, the UDP port,
01:36
and have your logs sent to a certain facility.
01:39
Let's click Close and go back to Log Settings.
5. RAM Memory Logging
01:42
As you'll notice there are several levels of
01:44
logging on this device starting with Emergency.
01:47
Let's talk about what each of these mean.
01:49
The Emergency level of severity
01:51
means the system is not usable.
01:53
An alert means that there's some
01:55
sort of action that's needed.
01:57
An event with critical severity means that
01:59
the system is in a critical condition.
02:02
An error means that there's an error in the system.
02:04
Warning means that a system warning has occurred and a
02:06
notice means that the system is functioning properly, but
02:09
it just wants to let you know that something has happened.
02:11
The informational level log is about device information.
02:16
And then if you're having an issue with the device, you can
02:18
log detailed debugging information about a particular event.
02:22
As you'll notice we don't have debug information selected.
02:26
But in our RAM logging , we're logging
02:27
all of the other device events.
02:30
Selecting a severity level causes all of
02:32
those events higher to be selected as well.
02:34
For example, we'll choose informational, and notice all
02:38
the more critical events above it are selected, too.
02:40
We can also specify the Originator Identifier in
02:44
our log messages by choosing None, or by hostname,
02:48
IP address, or a description of your choice.
6. Flash Memory Logging
02:52
For flash memory logging which will be available after a
02:54
system reboot, we're logging only a few top severity levels.
02:59
These events are aggregating in our error log every 300
03:01
seconds, and then sent off to our defined SYS log server.
03:05
Now let's take a look at some
03:06
of the events in the event log.
7. View Log
03:08
With logging now setup and enabled,
03:10
we're ready to view the logs.
03:11
To see the logs, click on Status and Statistics, View Log,
03:16
and then we can review both the RAM and Flash log entries.
03:20
Notice there are various events by
03:22
chronological order, newest on top.
03:25
On this device, we see mostly notices and
03:27
informational events, with an occasional warning.
03:30
Keep an eye out for important messages like failed
03:32
login attempts, logins from unauthorized workstations,
03:36
device restarts, down links, and much more.
8. Summary
03:40
That's a quick summary of device log auditing.
03:42
Remember to first enable logging so your device
03:45
will generate events in the logs, then you need
03:47
to take the time to periodically review the logs
03:50
to see if there is important information there.
