1. Data Destruction
00:06
When you dispose of a computer, selling used
00:08
hardware, or erasing important information, it's
00:11
crucial to destroy all of the data on a device.
00:14
It's not enough to delete the data.
00:16
Reformatting the hard drive is not even sufficient.
00:19
If other people can access your computer, they can
00:21
use data remanence, the residual representation of
00:24
erased data, to recover information.
00:26
You must damage the hardware so
00:28
badly that the remanence is gone.<br>
00:31
And don't paper documents.
00:33
Even in our digital world, a lot of
00:35
sensitive information is available in print,
00:37
and you must destroy that information, too.
00:39
If someone obtains your data, it might be
00:41
used to crack passwords, sell identification
00:44
information, or steal trade secrets.
00:46
That's why it's essential to be familiar
00:48
with the tools, techniques, and government
00:50
laws that apply to data destruction.<br>
2. Destruction Methods
00:53
There are wrong ways to destroy
00:54
data and then there is the right way.
00:57
You must use specialized tools to destroy data
01:00
remanence, so information is impossible to retrieve.
01:03
Data destruction tools use one of three techniques.<br>
01:07
Software programs write random code over and over on
01:10
top of the original data so that anything that can be
01:13
recovered from the hardware is just gibberish.<br>
01:17
Hardware tools damage hard disk drives so severely that it
01:21
is impossible to retrieve even pieces of data from the drive.<br>
01:25
There are also techniques that destroy the
01:27
ink on paper so that it's impossible to read.<br>
3. Data destruction and media sanitization
01:30
Let's look at sanitization programs first.
01:32
Sanitization programs wipe data off
01:35
your computer without damaging hardware.
01:38
This is commonly called purging, wiping, or clearing.
01:41
These techniques remove data from the hard
01:43
disk and then write over it so many times
01:46
that the data remanence is destroyed.<br>
01:49
Media sanitization options do not
01:50
destroy the hard disk for future use.
01:53
There are many data sanitization software programs you can
01:56
use to purge information, and some of them are even free.
02:00
Each has pros and cons; carefully consider the media type
02:03
you are purging, the level of data sensitivity, your budget,
02:07
and other factors when you select a sanitization software.<br>
02:11
The following options severely damage hardware
02:14
storage so that the device can never be used again.<br>
4. Shredding
02:17
One technique is running a hard disk through a
02:19
disk shredder, physically destroying the drive.
02:23
Disk shredders are effective, but also relatively expensive.<br>
02:27
Some organizations without a disk shredder will destroy a
02:30
disk by hammering or drilling holes into the disk platters.
02:34
Drilling and hammering are relatively
02:36
inexpensive and fairly efficient.
02:37
However, they are not as effective as a shredder.<br>
02:41
Another option is hiring a company to destroy disks.
02:45
Many companies that provide this service will
02:47
also provide a certificate of destruction.<br>
5. Pulverizing
02:49
Pulverizing is like shredding, except that it
02:52
uses a punch press or hammer system to crush a
02:55
hard disk into a pile of metal confetti.
02:58
Many companies that provide disk
02:59
shredding also provide pulverizing.<br>
6. Degaussing
03:02
One really effective technique is degaussing.
03:05
Degaussing purges the hard disk by exposing
03:07
it to an incredibly high magnetic pulse that
03:10
destroys all the data on the disk.
03:12
It also ruins the motors inside the drive.<br>
7. Destroying Paper Documents
03:15
Remember how we mentioned that you also need to destroy
03:17
paper documents that contain sensitive information?
03:21
Most offices contain paper shredders, which shred documents
03:24
into very small pieces, as small as one-seventeenth of an
03:28
inch which are then mixed with other trash.
03:30
But these paper pieces still contain ink.
03:33
There are two methods that destroy the
03:35
ink on the paper: burning and pulping.<br>
8. Burning
03:38
Burning documents is a pretty simple process.
03:40
Build a small fire somewhere legal and safe, then use metal
03:44
tongs to burn your documents one by one or a few at a time.
03:48
It's important to ensure that each document is turned
03:50
into ash, if sensitive information escapes the flames
03:53
and flies away, it might fall into the wrong hands.<br>
03:57
Burning blank papers with your critical
03:58
documents makes things more confusing if
04:01
someone tries to piece them back together.
04:03
Be sure to sift through all the remains and
04:05
make sure every bit of paper has turned to
04:07
ash before you dispose of the burnt remnants.<br>
9. Pulping
04:11
Pulping is a way of removing all traces of ink from paper
04:14
by using chemicals and then mashing the paper into pulp.
04:18
Since these chemicals can ruin carpet and
04:20
clothing, you should perform this process
04:22
outside and use protective gloves.<br>
04:25
First, you need to remove the documents from envelopes,
04:28
unfold them, and place them in a large trash can filled
04:30
with nine parts water and one part liquid bleach.
04:34
Second, completely submerge and soak the
04:37
documents in the solution for 24 hours.
04:39
Next, use a broomstick or a heavy-duty
04:42
mixer, such as a paint turbine mixer, to
04:44
mash the paper into a pliable liquid pulp.<br>
04:48
After that, spread the pulp out to dry in the sun.
04:51
Lastly, place the dried pulp into
04:53
garbage bags and throw it in the trash.<br>
10. Data sovereignty
04:55
Now that we have discussed ways to permanently
04:57
dispose of information, let's switching gears
05:00
to talk about the legal requirements of data
05:02
destruction, starting with data sovereignty.
05:05
Data sovereignty is the concept that
05:07
information stored in binary digital form is
05:10
subject to government laws and regulations.
05:13
Data sovereignty laws are created to maintain
05:15
privacy and prevent foreign countries from
05:17
subpoenaing, or searching, another's data.
05:20
Data sovereignty laws evolve rapidly as cloud
05:23
services and other new storage options emerge.<br>
11. Data Disposal Laws
05:26
It's imperative that you stay current with data
05:28
sovereignty laws because every business must comply
05:31
with state and federal data destruction regulations.
05:34
Data sovereignty laws protect citizens from
05:37
identity theft, companies from security
05:39
breaches, and clients from privacy issues.
05:41
They specify when, how, and what
05:43
data you are allowed to destroy.
05:45
Requirements vary depending on location, so make sure
05:48
you comply with the most up-to-date version of both state
05:51
and federal regulations, and remember, they frequently
05:54
change to keep up with the pace of technology.
05:57
No matter where you live in the US, you
05:59
will have to follow laws dictated by three
06:01
government acts: HIPAA, FACTA, and FISMA.<br>
06:05
HIPAA stands for Health Insurance
06:07
Portability and Accountability Act.
06:10
HIPAA protects medical records
06:11
and personal health information.
06:13
Companies that provide healthcare insurance
06:16
handle HIPAA-protected information.
06:18
And, of course, companies that provide health-related
06:20
services also handle HIPAA-protected information.<br>
06:24
FACTA, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions
06:27
Act, was created to protect against identity theft.
06:30
It applies to the disposal of consumer
06:33
reports and related information.
06:34
FACTA includes credit reports, credit scores, employment
06:39
history information, check writing history, insurance
06:42
claims, residential or tenant history, and medical history.
06:46
Every business handles FACTA-protected information,
06:49
and every business must comply with FACTA laws.<br>
06:52
FISMA, the Federal Information Security
06:56
Management Act, protects government information.
06:58
It is primarily concerned with proper data
07:01
destruction and has detailed disposal requirements.<br>
07:04
Regardless of which destruction method you use
07:07
and what type of information you destroy, you
07:09
need to carefully document each disposal process
07:12
with a certificate of destruction, or COD.
07:15
A COD is usually necessary to satisfy
07:18
internal security reporting requirements
07:20
as well as legal reporting requirements.<br>
07:23
A COD should specify the device and
07:25
the method and date of destruction.
07:27
This document should also provide a chain of
07:30
custody (each person who had possession of the data
07:33
and the length of time they possessed the data).<br>
07:36
If you destroy a storage device
07:38
yourself, you should create your own COD.
07:40
You can find COD templates on the internet.
07:43
If you contact a service provider to destroy your devices,
07:46
request that they provide a COD for each device they process.
07:50
Most organizations, especially military and
07:53
government agencies, retain CODs as a
07:55
permanent record of each device's destruction.<br>
12. Data Retention Policies
07:58
Companies should have data retention policies and
08:01
procedures for storing and destroying information.
08:03
By law, organizations must retain certain information
08:07
for specified time periods, and your business probably
08:10
has additional records to keep and maintain.
08:13
Always make absolutely certain that it is
08:16
okay to destroy papers, data, and drives.<br>
13. Summary
08:19
Remember, proper data destruction is
08:21
essential to securing information.
08:23
Not only must you use specialized tools and techniques
08:26
to damage the data beyond recovery, you must also comply
08:29
with all necessary laws and company policies, including
08:33
creating and maintaining a certificate of destruction.
08:36
Following these guidelines will protect your
08:38
organization from many security and legal problems.<br>
