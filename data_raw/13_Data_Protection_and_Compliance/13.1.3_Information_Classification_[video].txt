1. Information Classification
00:04
In this video, we're going to talk
00:06
about information classification.
00:07
There are several types of data, and
00:10
data needs to be classified and secured.
00:12
First, let's go over general classifications of data.
2. Classifications of Data
00:16
All data falls into one of five categories.
00:19
Public data is available to anyone.
00:21
Private data has limited distribution.
00:23
Sensitive data is for internal use.
00:26
Critical data is covered by laws and compliance regulations.
00:29
Proprietary data is exclusive to a particular entity.
00:33
Let's look at each of these in detail.
3. Public Data
00:36
The first information classification is Public.
00:38
This classification allows anyone
00:41
to have a copy of the information.
00:42
Examples include a public website that everyone can
00:45
access, company brochures, and marketing material.
00:48
This data exists to be released.
4. Private Data
00:51
Private data is not for general release to the public.
00:54
It includes internal email addresses, company meeting
00:57
notes, company presentations, and customer lists.
01:01
This is information you don't want released to the
01:03
public, but if it were accidentally released, damage
01:06
to your organization would be light to moderate.
5. Sensitive Data
01:10
Sensitive data is information that, if exposed,
01:13
could cause significant damage to an organization.
01:16
Sensitive data is restricted even within
01:19
the company that's responsible for it.
01:21
It may include strategic information,
01:23
customer lists, personally identifiable
01:25
information (PII), and company strategies.
6. Critical Data
01:29
Critical data includes personally identifiable
01:31
information, credit card data, health records, and
01:34
other information covered under compliance regulations.
01:37
These include The General Data Protection Regulation,
01:40
or GDPR, and The California Consumer Protection Act.
01:44
The disclosure of critical data will
01:46
cause severe harm and financial penalties.
7. Proprietary Data
01:49
Proprietary information includes information that's
01:52
unique and differentiates a company from its competitors.
01:55
Examples are Google's search algorithm, the recipe for
01:58
Coca-Cola, or patents granted for inventions and processes.
02:02
The release of this information would cause
02:04
serious damage, maybe even irreparable damage.
02:08
Now let's talk about very specific kinds of
02:11
data that need to be classified by a company.
02:13
This data is covered by laws, government
02:15
regulations, and compliance acts.
8. Data Types
02:19
The first is classified data.
02:21
Personal Identifiable Information includes almost any
02:24
data that can be used to identify a person: their name,
02:28
addresses, email, phone number, or even a photograph.
02:31
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
02:35
Act (HIPAA) has many facets, but the one that concerns
02:38
you most as a security administrator is their policy
02:40
on Electronic Health Information, or eHI.
02:44
This classification includes data related to an
02:47
individual's health and information collected by doctors,
02:50
health clinics, health insurance companies, and employers.
02:53
It must be secured in all usage
02:56
statesâ€“ at rest, in use, or in motion.
02:59
The exposure, loss, or breach of this data
03:03
incures significant fines from the U.S.
03:05
government.
03:06
Financial data is covered by a
03:08
few laws and compliance bodies.
03:10
It includes consumer credit card information, bank
03:12
account numbers, and corporate financial requirements.
9. Military and Government Data
03:16
There are also government/military classification levels.
03:20
The public can view Unclassified information.
03:23
The next classification is Sensitive, but Unclassified.
03:26
For this classification, the government or
03:28
military would prefer the information not be
03:31
available to the public, but it is unclassified.
03:34
Disclosure could cause harm, but the harm would be minimal.
03:38
The next level is Confidential.
03:40
It allows restricted information release
03:42
under the Freedom of Information Act.
03:44
The level above that is Secret, and it includes troop
03:47
movements, deployments, and overall capabilities.
03:50
The highest classification is Top Secret.
03:53
Release of Top-Secret information can pose a
03:56
grave threat to the country and national security.
10. Summary
03:59
That's it for this lesson.
04:01
In this lesson, we covered the different data
04:03
classifications and examples of data in each
04:05
classification: public, private, sensitive, and critical.
04:10
Then we looked at specific types of data,
04:12
including PII, ePHI, credit cards, and
04:16
unclassified, confidential, secret, and top-secret.
