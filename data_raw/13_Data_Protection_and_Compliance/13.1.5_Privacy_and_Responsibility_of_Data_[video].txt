1. Privacy and Responsibility of Data
00:04
We're going to spend a few minutes reviewing
00:06
some of the laws that have been enacted to
00:08
protect the privacy of electronic data.
00:11
The United States has passed a significant
00:13
number of laws regarding information security,
00:16
especially the privacy of electronic data.
00:19
Prior to the year 2000, there weren't many laws that
00:22
addressed this particular area of information security.
00:25
However, due to a rash of break-ins, exploits, and
00:28
another abuses, many states and the federal government
00:31
enacted laws to protect the privacy of electronic data.
00:35
A key thing to remember is that you need to
00:37
be very familiar with the requirements of
00:40
the laws that apply to your organization.
00:42
To protect your organization and to
00:44
protect yourself, you need to be aware of
00:46
how these laws apply to your organization.
00:49
This lesson addresses some of the higher profile data
00:52
privacy laws, but it doesn't identify all the laws
00:56
that apply to your organization, nor does it provide
00:59
minute details of each law that it does cover.
01:01
This lesson provides only a simple,
01:04
high-level overview of these laws.
01:06
You are responsible to research whether these
01:09
laws apply to your organization, and if so, how.
01:13
You are also responsible to be aware of other federal,
01:16
state, and even local laws that effect your organization.
2. HIPAA
01:20
Let's begin with the Health Insurance Portability
01:22
and Accountability Act of 1996 called HIPAA.
01:24
HIPAA specifies that all organizations having
01:29
anything to do with healthcare must protect
01:31
the health information that they maintain.
01:34
These organizations must implement policies and
01:37
procedures to protect this information,
01:39
regardless of the storage medium, such as paper
01:42
in a filing cabinet or electronic digital format.
01:45
HIPAA also establishes national standards for
01:48
transferring electronic healthcare information.
3. Sarbanes-Oxley Act
01:52
The next act you need to be familiar
01:54
with is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
01:54
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, sometimes referred
02:02
to as Sarbox, is the result of a flood of corporate
02:05
fraud in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.
02:08
Sarbox requires publically traded companies to adhere to
02:13
very stringent reporting requirements and implement strong
02:16
controls on electronic financial reporting systems.
02:19
A key point in Sarbox is that organizations
02:22
have to keep information for a certain time.
02:25
This especially relates to email.
02:27
In fact, Sarbox created an entire industry of
02:30
email archiving companies so that
02:32
organizations can comply with its regulations.
4. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
02:35
Next, we need to look at the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
02:38
Act, which we refer to as GLBA.
02:41
GLBA is designed to protect private data much
02:46
like HIPAA does; however, GLBA applies to private
02:49
information held at financial institutions.
02:52
There are two main functions of GLBA.
02:54
First, it requires all banks and any other
02:57
financial institutions to alert their customers
02:59
as to that organization's privacy policies.
03:02
If you've received a little pamphlet from
03:04
your financial institution that contained that
03:07
institution's privacy statement, that pamphlet
03:10
was in response to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
03:13
In addition, all personally identifiable financial
03:16
information (PII) within a financial institution—either
03:20
electronic or paper formats—has to be protected.
03:24
Essentially this act specifies that a policy must
03:27
be in place to protect private information from
03:30
foreseeable threats and to maintain data integrity.
03:33
In order to implement this, GLBA requires financial
03:37
institutions to put in place three main components.
03:40
The first one is the Financial Privacy Rule.
03:43
The second one is the Safeguards Rule.
03:45
And the third one is called Pretexting Protection.
03:49
Essentially, the Financial Privacy Rule requires all
03:52
financial institutions to provide each customer with
03:55
the privacy notice that we talked about earlier.
03:57
It must be provided at the time
03:59
the relationship is established.
04:01
That is, when you go in to open a new banking account.
04:04
It also has to be provided every year thereafter.
04:07
The Safeguards Rule requires financial institutions
04:10
to develop a written information security plan,
04:13
which describes in detail how the company plans to
04:16
protect clients' personal information.
04:18
Finally, Pretexting Protection encourages financial
04:21
institutions to train their staff how to recognize
04:25
social engineering exploits, which they call pretexting.
04:29
The reason is that social engineering
04:31
exploits use some type of pretext.
5. Patriot Act
04:34
You should also be familiar with the Patriot Act of 2001.
04:38
This act enables law enforcement agencies to detect
04:41
and suppress terrorism by giving law enforcement the
04:44
authority to request information from organizations.
04:48
All organizations, public or private, must
04:50
provide the requested information to the
04:52
appropriate law enforcement agencies under the
04:54
authority of a valid court order or a subpoena.
6. California Database Security Breach Act
04:58
The next law you need to be familiar with is the
05:00
California Database Security Breach Act of 2003.
05:04
This law specifies that any agency, person, government
05:07
entity, or company that does business in the state of
05:10
California must inform California residents within 48
05:13
hours if a database breach or other security breach
05:16
occurs in which personal information has been stolen or
05:19
is believed to have been stolen.
05:22
Most other states have similar state laws
05:24
modeled on the California Database Security
05:26
Breach Act of 2003, making it a significant act.
05:30
Therefore, use your favorite search engine to search
05:32
for similar acts in the states in which you do business.
05:36
If you do business in those states and your
05:38
organization has a breach of personal information,
05:40
then you are under a regulatory compliance
05:42
requirement to inform anyone who may be affected.
7. COPPA
05:46
Next, let's look at the Children's Online Privacy
05:49
Protection Act of 1998, which is referred to as COPPA.
05:54
COPPA requires organizations that provide online
05:57
services designed for kids below the age of 13—such as
06:00
websites and gaming sites—to obtain parental consent
06:03
prior to collecting a child's personal information and
06:06
using it, such as displaying it on the website,
06:09
selling it to a marketing company, and so on.
06:12
In addition, COPPA also specifies that such online services
06:15
cannot require kids to provide more information than what
06:19
they determine as reasonable in order to participate.
8. GDPR
06:22
The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is
06:26
a data compliance regulation that started in 2018.
06:29
GDPR provides sweeping changes to the way
06:32
customer data is treated in the European Union.
06:35
The regulation not only applies to countries that are
06:38
part of the EU, but it also applies to any company
06:41
that has customers that reside in the EU itself.
06:44
The regulation requires companies to be prepared to
06:48
tell costumers what data they have, where they got
06:51
it, who they've given it to, and how it's being used.
06:54
It also gives customers the right
06:56
to be forgotten in some cases.
06:57
Failure to adhere to the regulations can be costly.
9. California Consumer Privacy Act
07:01
The last one we'll look at is the California Consumer
07:05
Privacy Act, or CCPA, was passed in 2020 and was one
07:09
of the first data privacy acts in the United States.
07:12
The act applies to California state residents,
07:15
but companies that do business in the state and
07:17
meet other benchmarks must also comply.
07:20
The consumers' rights include the right to know what data
07:23
is collected and whether their data was sold and to whom.
07:26
The consumer is also allowed to access their
07:29
own data and able to deny the sale of it.
07:31
Under certain circumstances, they're allowed to have data
07:34
deleted and cannot be discriminated against for doing so.
10. Summary
07:39
That's it for this video.
07:40
This is not an all-inclusive list of laws and acts regarding
07:43
electronic data privacy with which you need to be familiar.
07:46
GDPR and CCPA are both relatively new, so
07:50
make sure you research laws that apply to
07:52
your organization beyond just these two.
07:55
It's also probably a good idea to use the
07:57
services of a lawyer who's familiar with this field
08:00
just to make sure that your organization stays in
08:02
compliance. Please note again that non-compliance
08:06
to these laws and regulations can be very costly.
