1. Summary
00:04
In this lesson, we're going to discuss personnel policies.
00:07
Employees are a critical part of any successful
00:09
business, but they also represent one of the
00:12
greatest risks to your organization's security.
00:15
Using proper employment practices helps mitigate this risk.
00:19
They should encompass all aspects of employment,
00:21
from pre-employment screenings to offboarding.
2. Pre-Employment
00:24
Employee security should start even
00:26
before an employee starts work.
00:28
To ensure that a potential employee is a low security
00:31
risk, an organization should perform a background check.
00:34
This check may include checking into a person's criminal
00:36
history, credit history, and employment history.
00:40
It could also involve drug testing, identity
00:42
verification, or a review of their social media presence.
3. Onboarding
00:47
Once you've decided to hire an individual, you'll
00:49
need to set up a work environment for them.
00:52
This process is called onboarding.
00:54
It primarily involves a lot of HR paperwork,
00:56
but there are a few onboarding procedures
00:58
that involve security professionals.
01:00
When you're setting up the new employee's user
01:02
accounts, security credentials, and building access,
01:05
make sure to assign the appropriate access rights.
01:08
To do this, you'll need to know the new employee's job
01:11
title, duties, and place in the organizational hierarchy.
01:15
It's also important that new employees
01:17
sign necessary forms and documents.
01:19
A non-disclosure agreement stipulates that
01:21
employees can't reveal confidential or
01:24
proprietary information to any non-employee.
01:27
A non-compete agreement prevents former
01:29
employees from working for competitors.
01:31
And an acceptable use policy specifies how
01:34
employees are allowed to use the information
01:35
organization's network resources.
4. Training
01:38
As we've discussed, employees are a serious security risk.
01:41
Sometimes they're intentionally trying to cause
01:43
harm, but more often, they're simply uninformed.
01:46
One way to help secure your data and your network is
01:49
to hold regular security trainings for your employees.
01:52
These trainings should include topics like how to
01:54
recognize security breaches and exploits when they
01:57
occur, what to do in the event of a security breach,
02:00
and sample scenarios with recommended responses.
02:03
Training should be ongoing and train employees on
02:06
new security issues and refresh them on older topics.
02:09
Ideally, you should use a combination of teaching
02:11
techniques so you have a better chance of engaging
02:13
everyone and helping them retain information.
02:17
In addition to classroom training, security methods
02:19
can be taught through games, simulations, role-based
02:23
hands-on training, or computer-based training.
5. Daily Operations
02:25
Onboarding and training provide a great starting
02:28
point, but you still need ongoing policies to ensure
02:31
that employee performance and duties are secure.
6. Separation of Duties
02:35
So, how can we better secure our daily operations?
02:38
First, let's look at separation of duties.
02:40
Separation of duties restricts the amount of access
02:43
or influence individuals control, which removes
02:45
single points of failure within the organization.
02:49
For example, let's say an employee in
02:51
accounting approves business expenses, verifies
02:54
expenditures, signs checks, and withdraws funds.
02:57
The risk of this employee embezzling company
02:59
money is significantly multiplied because
03:02
this one person performs all of these duties.
03:05
In this situation, this person could
03:07
easily become a single point of failure.
03:09
With separation of duties, expenditures and withdrawals
03:12
should be verified by at least two sets of people.
03:15
And maybe the CFO should sign the
03:17
checks instead of the accountant.
03:19
This way, we can eliminate this single point of failure.
7. Job Rotation
03:23
You can also enhance security
03:24
by implementing duty rotations.
03:26
For example, after a couple of months, each person's
03:28
responsibility shifts to another person, like a chore chart.
03:33
So, using our previous example, instead of signing
03:35
checks, the CFO verifies and approves expenditures,
03:39
while others handle withdrawals and signing checks.
03:42
Duty rotations also heighten security by continually
03:45
monitoring accountability during the rotation process.
8. Least Privilege
03:49
Now let's move on to the principle of least privilege.
03:51
The idea behind this principle is that
03:53
employees only have access to information
03:55
they absolutely need for their job function.
03:58
Employees with too much access could either
04:00
intentionally or unintentionally compromise security.
04:04
For example, administrative accounts should only be given to
04:07
people who need them, and this access should only be used by
04:10
employees who are actively performing administrative duties.
04:14
A best practice is to log in with a standard user
04:16
account and then only change to an administrative
04:19
account to perform a task that requires it.
04:22
When you're done with that task, you
04:23
switch back to the standard user account.
04:26
It's never a good idea to be logged in as
04:28
an administrator while browsing the web,
04:30
reading emails, or using social media.
04:33
An exploit coming through that internet connection could
04:35
easily obtain elevated privileges on that workstation,
04:38
which hugely increases the potential for damages.
9. Mandatory Vacations
04:42
Another practice to increase security
04:44
is a mandatory vacation policy.
04:47
The best way to implement mandatory vacations
04:49
is to require employees to request vacation days
04:51
in advance, like at the beginning of the year.
04:54
The benefits of mandatory vacations are twofold.
04:57
First, they allow employees to take a
04:59
break from work, rest, and recharge.
05:01
Second, they provide the security administrator the ability
05:04
to detect fraudulent activities while employees are away.
05:08
For example, if you notice that a reoccurring security
05:10
breach stops while a particular employee is away on
05:13
vacation, that could help you identify its cause.
10. Offboarding
05:16
The last step in employment is offboarding.
05:19
Whether an employee resigns, retires, or is terminated,
05:22
offboarding procedures keep the company safe as they depart.
05:26
First, you should disable or delete
05:28
that employee's user account.
05:30
An active, unused account allows
05:31
easy access to your network.
05:33
When you delete a user account, be sure not
05:35
to delete that user's data in the process.
05:39
Make sure their files are preserved.
05:40
You want that data available for future use.
05:43
So you may want to disable former
05:44
employees' accounts rather than delete them.
05:47
You should also change security keys and require
05:49
the return of access tokens, devices, and phones.
05:53
And when an employee leaves the organization, Human
05:55
Resources should always conduct an exit interview.
05:59
During this interview, it's important to address any
06:01
concerns, dissatisfactions, or feedback from the employee.
06:05
With this information, you'll have a better
06:06
idea of why the employee is leaving and be
06:08
able to address any remaining concerns.
06:11
This is also a good time to remind the employee of
06:13
any non-disclosure or non-compete agreements they
06:15
may have signed during their onboarding process.
11. Summary
06:18
That's it for this lesson.
06:20
In this lesson, we discussed the importance of
06:22
personnel policies during the pre-employment
06:25
process, onboarding, training, and daily operations,
06:28
and we finished by discussing offboarding policies
06:31
that protect the company and mitigate risks.
