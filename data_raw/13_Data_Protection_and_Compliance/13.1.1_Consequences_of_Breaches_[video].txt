1. Consequences of Data Breach
00:04
All too frequently, we read about a data breach.
00:06
Large companies with security budgets in
00:08
the millions of dollars are not exempt.
00:11
Most of us have, at onetime or another, been
00:13
notified that our information has been compromised.
00:16
It could be bank accounts, credit cards,
00:18
government records, or even health records.
00:20
All these data breaches come with serious consequences.
00:23
Let's talk about what they are.
2. Reputation Damage
00:25
A company's reputation determines if people will invest,
00:28
if consumers will buy, and if foreign governments will
00:31
allow a company to do business internationally.
00:34
A company lives or dies by its revenues and investments.
00:38
A breach that exposes private client data directly
00:41
affects the way consumers and investors spend money.
00:44
A data breach can cause stock prices to fall.
00:46
Falling stock prices lead to sell offs
00:48
and can permanently damage a company.
00:50
When trust is broken and consumer confidence is damaged,
00:54
revenues drop because consumers stop using the company.
00:57
Also, the loss of government contracts because
00:59
of breach can prove fatal for a company.
3. Identity Theft
01:02
Twenty years ago, the term identity theft didn't
01:04
have any real meaning to the everyday person.
01:06
Fast forward to today, and it is difficult to find someone
01:09
who hasn't experienced identity theft on some level.
01:12
When a breach occurs and personal information is stolen,
01:15
the affected person is forced to do hours, days, and even
01:18
weeks of work to correct someone else's mistake.
01:22
The effects of identity theft can last years and
01:24
cause fear and paranoia among those affected.
01:27
Lives have been turned upside down leaving
01:29
victims frustrated because it is almost
01:31
impossible to catch the perpetrator.
4. Fines
01:33
A data breach can also be financially costly.
01:36
With the introduction of GDPR and the California
01:38
Consumer Privacy Act the number of companies that
01:41
can be fined has grown significantly.
01:43
In the United States, HIPAA has always carried
01:46
fines for companies found in non-compliance.
01:49
Companies that profit from the use of consumer
01:51
personal information can also have heavy fines
01:53
levied by the Federal Trade Commission and
01:55
possibly the Security and Exchange Commission.
01:58
To give you an idea of the magnitude of these
02:00
fines, in 2019 three data breaches at three separate
02:04
companies cost the companies over 1 billion dollars.
02:07
It is estimated that fines for a single data
02:10
breach now averages $6.45 million dollars.
02:14
Intellectual Property is the lifeblood of companies.
02:17
When IP is stolen ,companies lose competitive advantage.
02:21
The internet has made the world smaller.
02:23
Companies are now competing with
02:24
others from around the globe.
02:26
IP stolen through a data breach is
02:28
often sold to competing companies.
02:30
Many of the overseas companies are not
02:33
subject to laws in the United States.
02:35
This makes it difficult to enforce IP laws.
02:38
The reverse engineering or the direct copy of
02:40
IP gives thieves an undeserved revenue source.
02:43
IP theft also floods the market with counterfeit goods.
02:48
Let's look at an IP theft scenario.
02:50
The XYZ company has worked tirelessly
02:53
on a new product that's cutting-edge.
02:55
As the company is going into production,
02:57
they experience a data breach.
02:58
They are not sure what data may have been lost.
03:01
A few months later, counterfeit versions of their
03:03
cutting-edge product start flooding the market.
03:06
They now discover that their intellectual
03:08
property was stolen during the breach.
03:10
The fakes are selling for less
03:11
money and destroying XYZ's profits.
5. Escalation
03:14
Escalation can be separated into two categories,
03:17
internal escalation and external escalation.
03:20
Internal escalation is part of a
03:22
company's incident response plan.
03:24
This usually means a tiered approach
03:26
to informing management of a breach.
03:28
As a breach is investigated, the findings and severity
03:31
will determine how far the escalation will go.
03:34
The external escalation involves experts brought in
03:36
from the outside to investigate, provide legal counsel,
03:39
or even prosecute, which involves law enforcement.
03:42
The key is to know when a situation has
03:45
surpassed your abilities to resolve it.
6. Summary
04:13
That's it for this lesson.
04:14
In this lesson, we showed you how data breaches
04:16
can have serious consequences including loss of
04:19
trust, fines, and theft of intellectual property.
04:23
Fines are averaging $6.45 million per event.
04:25
All 50 states have laws outlining the
04:28
data breach notification requirements.
04:30
We also looked at a scenario of
04:32
IP theft and its consequences.
