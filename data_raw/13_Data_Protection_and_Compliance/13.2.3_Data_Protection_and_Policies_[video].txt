1. Data Protection and Policies
00:04
In this lesson, I'm going to talk
00:06
about data protection and policies.
00:07
Data is a critical asset to all organizations,
00:10
which must put specific policies in place for
00:13
data creation, storage, and sharing.
2. Data Retention Policies
00:16
One important data protection aspect is data retention.
00:19
Data retention policies define how to
00:21
organize, maintain, and archive data.
00:23
They also outline how and when to dispose of information.
00:26
Different data types must be legally retained for different
00:29
lengths of time, depending on relevant regulations.
00:32
Most data retention policies also address how
00:34
to handle information involved in litigation.
00:38
When you're creating a data retention policy, you need to
00:40
identify the various data types your organization uses.
00:43
Develop a policy that defines how long each data
00:46
type should be retained as well as how they should
00:48
be destroyed when the retention time expires.
00:50
It's important to record this information
00:52
in a policy that's clearly written.
00:54
Having a written policy and ensuring that
00:56
everyone in the organization follows it helps to
00:58
protect you from evidence tampering accusations.
3. Data Retention Considerations
01:02
Adhering to your data retention policy
01:04
protects both you and your organization.
01:07
You should never allow selective or arbitrary information
01:09
destruction, which could make it appear as though you're
01:12
trying to hide evidence and could lead to criminal charges.
01:15
Never destroy information after it's been
01:17
subpoenaed or if you have reason to believe
01:19
that it may be subpoenaed in the future.
01:21
Evidence destruction and obstruction of justice
01:24
are serious crimes that can result in imprisonment.
4. Data Retention Rules Examples
01:26
With this in mind, let's take a look at
01:28
some examples of data retention rules.
01:30
These rules aren't necessarily the ones that
01:32
you'll use, but I'll go over them to give you
01:34
ideas on how you can formulate your own policies.
01:37
Email inboxes can pile up quickly, so
01:39
the first rule could state that all email
01:42
messages are to be deleted after 90 days.
01:44
The IRS defines guidelines for maintaining tax records.
01:47
To ensure compliance, you could say that your
01:49
policy is to keep company tax records for
01:51
seven years and employee tax records for four.
01:55
After that time, they're to be shredded.
01:57
When it comes to employee HR records, a good rule
01:59
of thumb is to keep them for three to four years.
02:01
You might see fit to hold onto all employee-created
02:04
research and design documents to prove their ownership.
02:06
So for the next rule, let's say the policy is to keep any
02:10
integral research, design, or patent documents for 25 years.
02:14
Next, are vendor contracts, service-level
02:16
agreements, and other types of contractual documents.
02:19
A good practice is to keep these until
02:21
five years after a contract has ended.
5. Classification Labels
02:23
After you create your written data retention policy,
02:26
consider using information classification labels to identify
02:29
which retention policy rules apply to which pieces of data.
02:33
This allows you to automate the data
02:35
retention and destruction process.
02:37
Without classification labels, it's an extremely tedious
02:40
process to try to manage decades-long data records.
6. Data Retention Policy Benefits
02:43
Having a solid data retention policy has a lot of benefits.
02:46
First, it reduces the discovery-request cost in the
02:49
event of legal action against your organization.
02:52
Responding to discovery requests
02:53
can be time consuming and costly.
02:56
You significantly minimize your discovery costs if all
02:58
your old, irrelevant material has already been destroyed.
03:01
Second, it reduces exposure during the discovery process.
03:05
By minimizing the amount of electronic material
03:07
that your organization keeps on hand, you also
03:10
reduce the amount of information that could
03:12
potentially expose your organization to litigation.
03:15
Third, it lowers the hardware and software requirements
03:17
for storing old data and minimizes clutter.
7. Summary
03:20
That's it for this lesson.
03:22
In this lesson, we talked about data protection and how
03:24
to create data retention policies for your organization.
03:27
We also talked about what specifically a data
03:29
retention policy is and the good practices you
03:32
should follow when creating one.
