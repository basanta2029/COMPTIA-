1. Screened Subnets
00:03
In this lesson, we'll discuss screened subnets.
00:05
A screened subnet allows you to expose an
00:08
organization's services to the internet or other
00:10
untrusted network while protecting the internal network.
00:14
Implementing a screened subnet is
00:15
part of a layered security approach.<br>
2. Network Boundaries
00:18
Let's look at how a screened subnet works.
00:20
Let's say you manage networks for a small company
00:23
that provides driver downloads for their products.
00:25
These drivers are accessed via a customer portal on
00:27
your website, which is hosted on an in-house web server.
00:31
The server resides in the company's internal network.<br>
00:34
For customers to access this web server and download
00:36
drivers, this server needs to be exposed to the internet.
00:40
One way to do this is to place the web
00:41
server outside the protected network.
00:43
In other words, on the other side of
00:45
the perimeter firewall, right here.
00:48
This would allow users to access the
00:49
drivers that reside on this web server.
00:51
However, this implementation would
00:53
create a significant security issue.<br>
00:55
This is because once you place the server outside the
00:58
firewall, you have no control over what happens to it.
01:01
Every hacker on the internet would be able to access this
01:04
web server very easily and run all types of exploits on it.
01:08
As you can see, this isn't a very good idea.<br>
01:11
However, moving the web server inside
01:13
the firewall presents another issue.
01:15
Chances are this firewall allows outbound
01:18
traffic but blocks all inbound traffic.
01:20
This makes the web server invisible to the
01:22
internet, and customers can't access the drivers.
01:25
To solve this, you could add a rule in the firewall's ACL to
01:28
allow connections using port 80, HTTP, and port 443, HTTP.<br>
01:34
With these ports open, users can initiate
01:36
connections from the internet to the web server.
01:39
But, again, this has some risks.
01:41
You've now opened two significant holes in the firewall
01:44
here, which has the potential for security breaches.
01:46
Many exploits take advantage of this scenario.<br>
01:50
An attacker gains access to the web server box
01:52
through the firewall using these two open ports.
01:54
The attacker then perpetrates a variety of exploits
01:57
on the web server, and since this web server is on
01:59
the same network as the rest of the network, the
02:01
attacker could compromise the entire network.
02:04
So, what can be done?<br>
02:05
One solution is to divide the network into
02:08
multiple zones of different levels of security.
02:11
You can create a high-security area and another area
02:14
within the network that has a lower degree of security.
02:17
You do this by creating a screened subnet.
02:19
Let's look at how to do this.<br>
3. Screened Subnet Creation
02:21
First, you'll need to open ports 80 and 443
02:24
on the firewall to let internet users initiate
02:27
connections to and access the web server.
02:29
We still have our firewall in place.
02:31
Opening these ports creates an area
02:33
of low security on the network.
02:35
The web server with open 80 and 443 ports is in
02:38
the low-security area directly behind the firewall.
02:41
To maintain the security of the rest of your network,
02:44
you need to install a second firewall between this
02:46
area of low security and your internal network.
02:49
By doing this, you create a zone of
02:51
high security for your internal network.<br>
02:54
Because this web server resides in the low-security
02:57
area with two ports open in the firewall, the web
02:59
server resides in the screened subnet.
03:01
The general rule is that you don't put anything in the
03:05
screened subnet that doesn't absolutely need to be there.
03:08
For example, the screened subnet isn't the
03:11
place to put your payroll or your R&amp;D servers.
03:14
Only the servers and information accessed by users
03:17
on the internet should be in the screened subnet.<br>
03:20
There's still a risk in having
03:21
this information on the web server.
03:23
Someone could break in and, for example, replace one of
03:26
the driver downloads with a modified version with a virus.
03:29
Be aware of that risk and monitor
03:31
the screened subnet for it.<br>
4. Two Firewall Solution
03:33
The second high-security internal firewall
03:35
behind the firewall keeps the low-security
03:38
area of the network to this single segment.
03:40
The internal network is secure behind the second firewall.
03:44
When planning your firewall rules, a general rule is that
03:47
you allow traffic originating in the secured internal network
03:51
into the screened subnet and through to the internet.<br>
03:54
For example, a user on your internal network
03:57
should be able to open a web browser and access
03:59
the internet through the various firewalls.
04:00
However, you must not allow traffic that originates
04:04
in the low-security area or the no-security area,
04:08
which is the internet, to establish a connection
04:10
with a host in the high-security area.<br>
5. Single Firewall Solution
04:13
You can also create a screened subnet
04:15
using a single firewall instead of two.
04:18
In this scenario, one firewall now has two network
04:21
connections and two network interfaces installed.<br>
04:25
One interface connects to the
04:26
internal high-security network.
04:28
The second connects to a separate isolated network segment.
04:31
You configure this firewall with different sets
04:33
of rules for the different network segments.<br>
04:36
You establish high-security firewall rules for the
04:39
internal network, creating the area of high security.
04:42
You implement lower-security rules, such as
04:45
allowing traffic through ports 80 and 443 for this
04:48
network segment where the web server resides.
04:51
This creates a screened subnet security zone.<br>
04:54
The lower-security rules for this network segment allow
04:57
internet connections to the web server on ports 80 and 443.
05:01
You should harden this server as much as
05:03
possible because it's sitting in a
05:05
lower-security area inside the screened subnet.<br>
6. Two vs. One
05:08
Each of these options has its strengths and weaknesses.
05:11
The two-firewall system requires more
05:14
hardware and, therefore, requires you to
05:16
administer two separate firewall systems.
05:18
The benefit is that an attack on the firewall
05:20
has no effect on the internal firewall.
05:23
Everything on the high-security network in the
05:25
high-security zone could be functioning just fine
05:28
while the firewall is experiencing continual attacks.<br>
05:31
The single-firewall solution with multiple interfaces
05:34
requires less hardware than the first solution.
05:36
Therefore, you maintain only a single system.
05:39
The single-firewall solution allows you
05:41
to create multiple screened subnets.
05:44
You can create multiple security zones with the one
05:46
firewall device by adding additional interfaces.
05:49
You could have a very high-security zone, a
05:51
medium-security zone, and a low-security zone.
05:55
The drawback to this approach is that
05:57
it introduces a single point of failure.
05:59
If that firewall goes down,
06:01
everything else goes down with it.<br>
7. Summary
06:04
In this lesson, we discussed screened subnets.
06:06
We first defined what a screened subnet is.
06:08
We then looked at different ways to create a
06:10
screened subnet with multiple firewalls or a single
06:13
firewall with multiple interfaces installed.<br>
