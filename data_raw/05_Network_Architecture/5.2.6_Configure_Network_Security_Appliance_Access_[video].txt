1. Configuring Network Security Appliance Access
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to secure access to our
00:08
LAN and WAN interfaces and configure IP addresses to them.
00:11
We're also going to work with user accounts on a network
00:14
security appliance. We're using a pfSense
00:17
security appliance, which has a graphical interface
00:20
for configuration that's accessible through a web browser.
2. Sign In
00:23
I'm here at the login screen, and I'll sign
00:25
in with the default username of ‘admin'.
00:27
For this pfSense device, the default password is ‘pfsense'.
00:32
I'll click Sign In to log on.
3. Configure LAN Interface
00:35
The first thing I want to do is configure
00:37
the IP address on my WAN and my LAN.
00:40
We'll start with the LAN settings.
00:41
Go up to Interfaces > LAN, and that
00:44
takes us to the LAN configuration page.
00:47
If I look here, the IPv4 Configuration
00:50
Type is set to Static IPv4.
00:52
DHCP is the other option there.
00:55
I need to change it to a different IP address.
00:58
I want to change it to ‘10.10.10.1', so I'll do that now.
01:03
Now I want to confirm that my subnet
01:05
is set to the /24 subnet mask.
01:08
That's all I need to do on this page.
01:10
I'll scroll down and click Save.
01:12
The page refreshes and says that the LAN
01:15
configuration has changed, and I need to
01:17
click Apply Changes for it to take effect.
01:20
It reminds me to change my DHCP
01:22
server configuration if needed.
01:24
Since my IP address is in the same subnet range as
01:27
it was before, my DHCP configuration is still okay.
01:31
Just make sure the IP you assigned is not in
01:34
the scope of IPs you've configured to be leased.
01:37
Click Apply Changes.
01:39
Now, if you look up at my address,
01:40
you'll see that it says 10.10.10.254.
01:44
When I log back in, I need to go to
01:46
the new address that I configured.
01:49
I've found that you sometimes get a token error
01:51
if you just try to log back in, so I'm going to
01:54
close my web browser and open it back up.
01:58
Now let's type in '10.10.10.1'
02:01
to get back to our Sign In page.
02:03
I'll put my credentials back in here and click Sign In.
02:08
I'll go back to my LAN interface, and
02:10
you can see that my changes are there.
4. Configure WAN Interface
02:13
Now let's configure our WAN settings.
02:16
Once again, I'll go to Interfaces.
02:18
But this time, I'll select WAN from the list.
02:21
Right now, I'm getting an IP for my WAN interface via DHCP.
02:25
I want to configure this with a static IP, so I'll change
02:28
that to Static IPv4 from our IPv4 configuration type.
02:33
Now, for an IP address, I'll give it ‘192.168.25.254'.
02:40
Right away, you might be saying, "Hey,
02:42
that's a Class C Private IP address."
02:44
If so, you're absolutely correct.
02:46
I'm on a test network that's connected to my
02:48
regular network, which is using the 192.168 scheme.
02:52
I need to set my subnet mask to /24 here.
02:55
For this demo, I'm not going to configure DHCP version 6.
03:00
I'm going to leave everything else set to
03:02
the defaults and click Save to continue.
03:07
I get a few reminders, just like
03:08
we did with the LAN configuration.
03:10
I'll click Apply Changes.
5. Configure WAN DNS
03:12
Now I want to configure the DNS that my WAN will use.
03:16
A lot of devices will have those settings
03:18
right here, with the WAN settings.
03:19
But with this device, we need to
03:21
go up to System > General Setup.
03:24
I'm going to add a few DNS servers here.
03:26
But first, let's take a look at the
03:28
current status of our WAN interface.
03:30
To do that, I'll go to Status > Interfaces.
03:33
Here, we see that my DNS server is
03:35
using the home address of 127.0.0.1.
03:40
IPv4 network standards reserve the entire address block
03:44
127.0.0.0/8 for loopback purposes, so this is normal.
03:49
I want to change those to a different DNS,
03:52
so let's go back to System > General Setup.
03:56
Beneath DNS Server Settings, I'll put
03:58
in the Google DNS IP of ‘8.8.8.8'.
04:02
Now I'll click the Add DNS Server button, and this
04:05
time, I'll put in the other Google DNS IP of ‘8.8.4.4'.
04:11
I'm going to check this box, Disable DNS Forwarder.
04:14
For this demo, I don't want my local host,
04:17
127.0.0.1, to be used as my first DNS server.
04:22
Checking the box will remove the local host DNS.
04:25
I'm only doing this to demonstrate
04:26
what happens when you check the box.
04:28
I'll scroll down to save these settings.
04:31
Now let's look at the status of our interfaces.
04:36
We can see our DNS settings are
04:38
now set to the Google DNS servers.
04:40
That wraps up configuring IP interfaces.
6. Add User
04:43
Now let's add an additional user to our pfSense appliance.
04:47
To add a user, we need to go up to System > User Manager.
04:51
You can see here that we have just one user, the admin user.
04:55
It's good practice not to use the
04:56
admin account for normal maintenance.
04:58
You usually want to create a separate account for each
05:01
person that might mange the device, collect logs, and so on.
05:05
We can also track the logon and logoff events
05:08
of the users in case something happens.
05:11
I'll add the user by going over
05:13
and clicking the Add User button.
05:15
I'll enter in a username of ‘Rachel McGaffey'.
05:18
I'll give Rachel a password, and I'll put
05:20
the password in a second time to confirm it.
05:22
Now, under Full Name, I'll enter in ‘Rachel McGaffey'.
05:26
That's really all that's required.
05:27
But if I wanted to, I could check this box
05:30
to customize the GUI for Rachel's account.
05:33
Let's take a look at some of those options.
05:35
After I check the box, I get some more options.
05:38
I can change the theme for her
05:39
account from this dropdown list.
05:41
We can change the top navigation of the page here.
05:45
We can change how the hostname appears in the
05:47
menu and change the amount of dashboard columns.
05:51
If we want things like WAN and LAN to be
05:54
sorted alphabetically, we can change that too.
05:56
If we have groups set up, we
05:58
can change the memberships here.
05:59
But we won't make any changes to these right now.
06:02
Let's come down and click Save.
7. Session Timeout
06:04
One thing we don't want to happen with our
06:06
security appliance is have someone logged
06:08
in to it make configuration changes.
06:11
If a user gets called away from his or her
06:13
desk and doesn't sign out, anyone can sit down
06:16
at their computer and start messing around.
06:18
To mitigate this risk, we want to configure Session Timeout.
06:22
I'll click on the Settings tab.
06:24
Under Session Timeout, I'm going
06:25
to change this to 10 minutes.
06:27
That is actually a long time, and you might
06:29
want to set this to a lower amount of time.
06:32
Having no timeout is a huge security risk.
06:35
You'll have to judge your circumstances and
06:37
decide what session timeout settings are best.
8. Change Default Admin Password
06:40
The last thing I want to do in this demo
06:42
is change the default admin password.
06:45
Default passwords for devices are
06:46
easy to find with a simple web search.
06:49
It's such a problem, some US states and other
06:51
governments have forced many tech manufacturers to
06:54
make the devices they produce have random passwords.
06:58
Even if your device comes with a random password already
07:00
configured, those passwords are often printed on the
07:04
device somewhere, so it's always recommended that you
07:06
change it—that should be the very first thing you do.
07:09
To change this password for the admin
07:11
account, I'll click on the edit icon here.
07:14
I'll type in my new password.
07:15
Now I'll type it a second time to confirm it.
07:21
Come down and click Save, and that's all there is to it.
9. Summary 
07:24
That's it for this demonstration. In this demo,
07:27
we configured a network security appliance. We
07:29
configured the LAN and WAN IP addresses.
07:32
We changed the WAN DNS.
07:34
We created a second account on the device.
07:36
We configured a session timeout.
07:39
We ended the demo by changing the default admin
07:41
password to something more secure.
