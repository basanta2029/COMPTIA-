1. Router ACLs
00:04
Like a firewall, a router can use access control lists
00:07
(ACLs) to protect a network from attacks and control
00:10
what type of communications are allowed on the network.
00:13
Don't confuse the ACL on a router with its routing table.
00:17
The routing table is used to determine
00:18
where network packets are forwarded to.
00:20
The ACL, on the other hand, is used to determine
00:23
whether or not a packet is allowed to be forwarded.
2. Router ACL Basics
00:26
For example, an ACL on a router could ban all incoming
00:30
traffic destined to a specific IP address inside the network.
00:33
Any packet destined for that IP address is dropped.
00:36
However, outgoing packets from that
00:38
IP address are still permitted.
00:40
When you create an ACL on a router, it almost always
00:43
includes a hidden deny any statement at the end of the list.
00:47
This means all traffic is automatically blocked.
00:50
To allow traffic, you need at least one permit
00:52
statement that either permits a specific traffic type
00:55
or permits all traffic not specifically restricted.
00:59
The type of traffic you are able to control with
01:01
an ACL depends on the type of ACL you create.
01:04
Routers primarily use two ACL types:
01:06
standard ACLs and extended ACLs.
3. Standard ACLs
01:09
A standard ACL is only able to filter traffic based
01:13
on the source host name or host IP address--that is,
01:16
it can't filter traffic based on port number,
01:18
destination host name, or host IP address.
01:21
For example, you could configure a standard ACL to
01:25
only allow traffic coming from internal IP addresses.
01:28
All traffic coming from external
01:30
IP address would be dropped.
01:32
You could also configure a standard ACL to block all traffic
01:35
from a specific IP address, but allow all other traffic.
01:39
Know that because of how they function, standard ACLs
01:42
should be placed as close to the destination as possible.
01:45
So, what if you wanted to block traffic based
01:48
on other parameters, such as port number?
01:51
To do this, you use the second type of ACLâ€”"an extended ACL.
4. Extended ACLs
01:55
Extended ACLs are used to filter traffic based
01:58
on a lot more parameters than standard ACLs.
02:01
In addition to filtering based on source host name
02:04
or host IP address, an extended ACL can filter based
02:07
on source IP protocol, source or destination socket
02:10
number, and destination host name or host IP address.
02:14
For example, you could block all outgoing traffic
02:17
except for traffic on ports 80 and 443, or you
02:20
could block all traffic from inside the network
02:22
that's destined for a specific IP address.
02:25
Unlike standard ACLs, extended ACLs should
02:27
be placed as close to the source as possible.
5. Summary
02:31
That's it for this lesson.
02:32
In this lesson, we looked at router ACLs.
02:35
We looked at how ACLs on a router work and what
02:37
parameters are defined when they are created.
02:39
We then looked at the two types of ACLs
02:41
routers use, standard ACLs and extended ACLs.
