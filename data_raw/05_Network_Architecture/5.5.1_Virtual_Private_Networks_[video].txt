1. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
00:04
A virtual private network (VPN) uses encryption
00:07
to send data securely over an untrusted network.
00:10
The high cost of dedicated WAN connections was one of
00:13
the mains reasons for VPNs to be used by organizations.
00:17
A VPN takes advantage of an existing internet
00:19
connection to communicate securely between devices.
00:22
Let's see how this is done.
00:24
VPNs provide a secure internet connection between
00:27
locations by encrypting packets in transit.
2. Encapsulation
00:30
A VPN uses a protocol that tunnels, or encapsulates,
00:33
each of those packets into a new packet.
00:36
Information in the packet header of these encrypted
00:38
packets routes the information through the internet.
00:41
On the destination device, the outer wrapping of
00:44
the packets is removed, and the packet is
00:46
decrypted—"the data is back in its original format.
00:50
If an attacker were to intercept packets sent via a
00:53
VPN, they wouldn't be able to read any of the contents.
00:56
Only the device on the other end has the appropriate
00:59
decryption key that allows them to view the packet contents.
01:02
Now, there are multiple ways that you
01:04
can configure a VPN through the internet.
3. Host-to-Host VPN
01:07
The first way is using a host-to-host VPN.
01:10
This type of VPN allows an individual host connected to
01:13
the internet to establish a VPN connection to another host.
01:16
With a host-to-host connection, both
01:19
devices need the ability to establish and
01:21
understand the VPN protocol that's used.
01:24
Both devices must have the software for encrypting
01:27
the packets and encapsulating the packets.
4. Site-to-Site VPN
01:31
Another way is using a site-to-site VPN.
01:33
With a site-to-site VPN, you have a
01:36
collection of computers at each location.
01:38
Each computer in any location is able to communicate
01:41
securely with any other computer at another location.
01:45
Rather than requiring VPN configuration on
01:48
every single computer, you install a single
01:50
device, which acts as a gateway server.
01:53
A VPN gateway is a dedicated VPN device that
01:56
handles VPN connections, as well as the encryption
01:59
and decryption of packets sent over the internet.
02:02
The nice thing about using a VPN gateway is the
02:05
protocols and encapsulation method only need to be
02:08
configured and maintained on a single device for the
02:11
entire network, instead of on each individual device.
02:14
It also allows for all traffic between the two
02:17
sites to be encrypted 100 percent of the time.
5. Remote Access VPN
02:20
The final method is a remote access VPN.
02:23
In this case, individual hosts on the network can
02:26
establish a VPN connection to the remote site.
02:29
In this configuration, the client computer
02:31
must be able to establish the VPN connection
02:33
with a special device called a VPN concentrator
02:36
that sits on the edge of the private network.
02:41
VPN concentrators are hardware devices that are
02:42
dedicated to establishing client connections, as
02:45
well as encrypting and decrypting VPN packets.
02:48
Each client is configured with software
02:50
that allows it to encrypt packets.
02:52
The VPN concentrator is configured to
02:54
allow or reject connections from users.
02:57
It also removes the encryption before forwarding
03:00
the information to the private network.
6. VPN Protocols
03:02
Now, VPNs can use a few different methods to
03:05
establish connections and encrypt traffic.
03:08
These methods are known as VPN tunneling protocols.
03:11
The two most commonly used VPN
03:13
tunneling protocols are IPsec and SSL.
03:15
IPsec encrypts contents sent through
03:18
a tunnel created by another protocol.
7. IPsec
03:20
IPsec is probably one of the most common tunneling
03:23
encryption mechanisms currently used, and IPsec is
03:26
actually made up of two different protocols.
03:28
The first one is the Authentication Header, or AH.
03:32
The second one is the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
03:35
AH is used to authentic the connection, while ESP is used to
03:40
encrypt the data that's being sent through the connection.
03:43
When you implement IPsec, you can use
03:45
either of these protocols by themselves.
03:47
For example, if you chose to implement AH only, then
03:50
your VPN will have authentication, but no encryption.
03:53
In most cases, you'll want to make sure that
03:55
your VPN solution using IPsec includes ESP.
03:57
IPsec also has two different modes for
04:02
sending packets through the tunnel.
04:04
The first way is called transport mode.
04:07
With transport mode, IPsec only
04:08
encrypts each packet's internal data.
04:12
Everything else—"the destination IP address,
04:14
the origination IP address—"is all in cleartext.
04:18
The second mode is called tunneling mode.
04:20
In tunneling mode, the entire packet is encrypted.
04:23
It is then encapsulated in another
04:25
non-encrypted packet—"complete with a new
04:28
IP header—"and sent over the internet.
04:31
Tunnel mode is usually the default sending mode for IPsec.
8. SSL
04:34
Another protocol that can be
04:36
used for a VPN connection is SSL.
04:37
SSL's been around for a long time.
04:41
It's been used in combination with other protocols, mostly
04:44
HTTP, in order to secure traffic between two devices.
04:48
For example, if you were to go to an online store and
04:51
purchase a product, more than likely, you're going to
04:53
use the secure version of HTTP—"HTTPS—"to protect the
04:58
credit card information we're sending to the web server.
05:00
Well, HTTPS leverages SSL to encrypt
05:04
the traffic between those two devices.
05:06
This makes SSL a great option for encrypting other types
05:09
of connections between devices, such as a VPN connection.
05:12
SSL requires certificates for identity
05:15
proof, as well as for encryption.
05:18
One of the benefits of using SSL
05:20
is the fact that it uses port 443.
05:22
This is really important because most network firewalls
05:25
in most organizations are already configured to allow
05:28
HTTPS traffic on this port, so we don't have to make any
05:32
major firewall changes if we want to deploy an SSL VPN.
9. Split Tunnel vs. Full Tunnel
05:36
There's one more VPN configuration option we need
05:38
to discuss, and that is the different between
05:40
split tunnel and full tunnel VPN configurations.
05:44
With a split tunnel VPN, only certain types of
05:47
traffic—"for example, traffic destined for a specific
05:50
IP address range—"are sent through the VPN connection.
05:53
All other traffic goes through the internet as normal.
05:56
This configuration might be good for people who need to
05:58
access private network resources but still want to access the
06:02
internet through their own internet, and not through the VPN.
06:05
It also helps reduce the amount of traffic sent
06:08
through the VPN—"instead of sending all traffic
06:10
through the VPN, only necessary traffic is sent.
06:14
Split tunneling also has something
06:16
called inverse split tunneling.
06:18
This is where all traffic is sent through the VPN
06:20
except for a specific type of traffic, which is
06:23
routed through the regular internet, unencrypted.
06:25
The split is inverted, as its name suggests.
06:29
The other way you can configure the VPN is to route all
06:32
traffic through the VPN, regardless of the type of traffic.
06:36
This is usually the default VPN configuration method.
10. Summary
06:39
When you implement a VPN, be sure to select
06:42
a protocol supported by all of the devices
06:44
that need to encrypt or encapsulate packets.
06:47
When you use a VPN through a firewall,
06:49
make sure you open the necessary ports to
06:51
allow the VPN traffic through the firewall.
06:53
In addition, make sure you know which type of VPN
06:56
connection and configuration is best for your organization.
