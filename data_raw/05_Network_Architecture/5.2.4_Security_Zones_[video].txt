1. Security Zones
00:03
In this lesson, we're going to discuss security zones.
00:05
Security zones are portions of the network that
00:07
have specific security concerns or requirements.
00:11
All devices within the same zone have the
00:12
same security access and protection needs.<br>
00:15
These zones are often separated by a traffic
00:18
control device, such as a firewall or a router,
00:20
that filters incoming and outbound traffic.<br>
00:23
For example, you can define a zone that
00:25
includes all hosts on your private network
00:27
that need to be protected from the internet.
00:29
You can also define a zone within your
00:31
network for controlled access to specific
00:33
servers that hold sensitive information.<br>
2. Screened Subnets
00:36
There are several types of security
00:38
zones that can be implemented.<br>
00:40
Let's start with a security zone known as a screened subnet.
00:42
A screened subnet is used as a
00:45
public-facing accessible network.
00:47
It acts as a buffer and a barrier to your internal
00:49
production network, which is accessible from the internet.
00:53
A screened subnet can be configured using either
00:55
one or two firewalls and acts as the middleman
00:58
between the internet and your internal network.<br>
01:01
For example, a screened subnet is often used to
01:03
allow employees access to critical network
01:05
components, such as email servers, VPN connections,
01:09
and internal web servers, from outside the company.
01:12
Screened subnets also provide customer access
01:15
to a company's products, such as software.<br>
01:18
To do this, the firewall allows traffic from the
01:20
internet into the screened subnet and enables those
01:23
resources to access resources on the production network.
01:26
The servers placed in the screened subnet
01:29
are typically configured as a bastion host.
01:31
A bastion host is a server that's specifically
01:33
designed and configured to withstand attacks.
01:36
In general, they're specific-purpose systems that host
01:39
a single application and are hardened to resist attacks.<br>
3. Wireless Zone
01:43
Another type of security zone is a wireless network zone.
01:46
A wireless network zone is a broadcasted
01:49
network connection used within an organization
01:51
where users don't need a physical connection to
01:53
a network port to connect to internal resources.<br>
01:56
Instead, they use a wireless connection on their
01:58
device to connect to a wireless access point.
02:01
For internal users, the effect is the same as
02:03
if the user's device has a physical connection
02:05
and provides access to internal resources.<br>
4. Guest Network
02:09
Several organizations also create a guest network
02:11
that allows non-internal staff to access the internet.
02:14
In some cases, guests may also be granted
02:17
access to a few limited internal resources.<br>
5. HoneyNet
02:20
A honeynet contains servers designed to trap attackers.
02:24
The servers, or honeypots, contain
02:26
intentional vulnerabilities to lure attackers.
02:29
Attackers believe they're accessing vulnerable
02:31
systems, but they're really inside a trap.
02:34
Honeypots are designed to mimic production servers
02:36
that would be found in a typical organization.
02:38
Of course, they contain no real company
02:40
information, so there's little risk of exposure.
02:43
The honeypots track an attacker's activity and can
02:46
generate extremely useful security information.<br>
6. Ad hoc Network
02:49
An ad hoc network is a decentralized network that allows
02:52
connections without a traditional base station or router.
02:56
It allows users to connect two or more devices
02:58
directly to each other for a specific purpose.
03:01
Ad hoc is a Latin term that translates to
03:04
"for this," and ad hoc networks are usually
03:07
temporary solutions for a specific task.<br>
03:10
Ad hoc connections can be wired or wireless.
03:13
If you're connecting two systems with an
03:14
Ethernet cable, it must be a crossover cable.
03:18
An ad hoc network can also be created using Wi-Fi.
03:21
Of course, the Wi-Fi parameters and protocols must
03:23
match and be compatible with each other, including
03:27
the SSID, security, and encryption settings.<br>
7. Network Address Translation
03:30
Network Address Translation, or NAT, provides global IP
03:34
address conversion for the entire network and is usually
03:37
performed by your internet gateway, or NAT server.
03:40
NAT allows network administrators to manage
03:43
IP addresses within the internal network
03:45
using whatever private IPs they want.
03:47
When a user needs to access the internet, the NAT server
03:50
then translates these internal private IP addresses to
03:53
public IP addresses that the internet can recognize.<br>
03:57
The organization's internet service provider
03:59
can supply internet routable IP addresses and
04:02
assign them to the organization.
04:04
When information returns, the internet gateway
04:06
converts the public address back to the private address
04:09
and sends it on to the private network and user.<br>
8. Summary
04:13
That's it for this lesson.
04:14
In this lesson, we discussed
04:15
several types of security zones.
04:17
First, we discussed screened subnets,
04:19
where servers are placed for public access.
04:22
Next, we discussed wireless zones, which allow
04:24
employees to access internal resources using Wi-Fi
04:28
and provide guest networks that limit access.
04:31
Then, we talked about honeynets, which are
04:33
used to trap attackers and gather information.
04:36
We ended this lesson by discussing ad hoc networks,
04:39
which are used for temporary connectivity between
04:41
two or more devices, and NAT servers, which convert
04:44
private IP addresses to public IP addresses.<br>
