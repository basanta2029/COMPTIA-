1. Device Vulnerabilities
00:04
Attackers try to exploit a wide range of
00:06
potential vulnerabilities that organizations
00:08
may not realize they even have.
00:10
For this reason, security professionals must do all they
00:13
can to reduce the attack surface their company presents.
00:16
In this lesson, I'll discuss several methods
00:18
for reducing your attack surface and creating a
00:21
company profile that's as secure as possible.
00:23
Let's first look as some often-misconfigured devices
00:26
that may open up opportunities for an attack.
2. Misconfigured Devices
00:30
Remember that your attack surface increases
00:32
each time a device is added to your network.
00:34
This provides threat actors more opportunities
00:36
to find openings in your network shield.
00:39
These malicious users continually look for entry
00:41
points, so it's important to ensure that each new
00:43
device is properly configured and protected.
00:47
For example, firewalls are one of those
00:48
entry points that are often misconfigured.
00:51
Knowing this, attackers often look for firewalls with
00:53
too many open ports or other security weaknesses.
00:56
In addition, servers or appliances that are set up to
00:59
block malicious payloads in emails could let spam and
01:02
malware into the company if not configured properly.
01:05
This could lead to data loss or corruption.
01:08
Wireless access points are another area that, if not
01:10
configured appropriately, could lead to potential attacks
01:13
by allowing attackers into the production network.
01:16
Using weak or outdated security protocols such
01:19
as WEP is an open invitation for attackers.
01:22
Once they have access to the internal network,
01:24
the damage quotient is critically high.
3. Weak Security
01:27
Another attack surface to be aware of is security.
01:29
The old adage says, "A chain is
01:31
only as strong as its weakest link."
01:33
Attackers are experts at finding the
01:35
smallest hole or chink in the armor.
01:37
If they want in, they'll get in.
01:39
The question is how difficult it'll be for them.
01:42
Unfortunately, when something works,
01:43
it's often difficult to make changes.
01:45
For compatibility reasons, administrators might use outdated
01:48
and insecure security protocols such as SHA1 and WEP.
01:52
So every effort to utilize updated and secure protocols
01:55
such as 3DES, SHA-256, and AES should be made.
01:59
Another easy security attack comes from using the default
02:02
credentials for your network devices, such as routers.
02:06
Most attackers find that a 10 second Google
02:08
query can provide the default username and
02:10
password for commonplace devices.
02:13
With little effort, an attacker can usually discover the
02:15
make and model of the device he or she wants to attack.
02:18
Those are the credentials they'll try first.
02:20
To help overcome this weakness, some manufacturers are
02:23
becoming more security conscious and require a change
02:26
to the defaults as part of the installation process.
02:29
Others make their device inoperable until the
02:31
default configuration credentials are changed.
4. Updates
02:33
As computer networking professionals, we're very familiar
02:36
with operating system and application software updates.
02:39
These updates provide the latest patches,
02:41
add functionality, and close security holes.
02:44
The same is true for firmware.
02:46
Firmware updates might include protocol updates
02:48
that enable newer, more secure encryption.
02:50
As an example, the famous WannaCry
02:52
ransomware attack of 2017 took
02:55
advantage of a weakness inherent in the SMBv1
02:57
Protocol that allowed a remote attacker to
03:00
take complete control of the affected system.
03:02
This could've been prevented with security-minded updates.
5. Credential Management
03:05
Now, let's look at credential management.
03:07
Unfortunately, some administrators use the same credentials
03:10
in an attempt to ease the device management burden.
03:13
Even though the new credentials might be different from the
03:16
default ones, doing this is still a massive security risk.
03:19
It might be convenient, but if any one
03:21
device becomes comprised, the attacker then
03:23
has access to all device configurations.
03:26
Your network is greatly compromised when this
03:28
happens, and you might even have to reset all your
03:30
devices to factory defaults and reconfigure them.
03:34
Another potential vulnerability concern
03:36
is the use of discretionary credentials.
03:38
The principle of least privilege is paramount here.
03:41
Users should only be given credentials with permissions
03:43
that match their specific job responsibilities.
03:46
If a user is given more privileges than he or she needs, an
03:49
attacker could use their account to find much more
03:52
potentially sensitive data than would otherwise be the case.
6. Physical Access
03:55
Next, let's go over physical access.
03:57
If someone is given physical access to a device,
04:00
there's very little opportunity for protection.
04:02
For example, an attacker can change passwords or
04:05
add credentials to a firewall with physical access.
04:07
Or they can use a USB flash drive
04:09
to copy data or inject malware.
04:11
As such, you should confine infrastructure equipment to
04:14
secure areas that only authorized personnel have access to.
04:18
In addition, you should make sure that any attempted access
04:21
without proper credentials sets off alarms and alerts.
7. Known and Unknown Vulnerabilities
04:24
One of the hard things about keeping your devices safe
04:27
is trying to protect them from unknown vulnerabilities.
04:30
Unknown vulnerabilities are often
04:32
referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities.
04:32
A zero-day vulnerability is a software security
04:37
weakness that's unknown to the developer.
04:39
Since these vulnerabilities are unknown,
04:41
attackers who discover them quietly try to
04:43
continue exploiting them without detection.
04:46
Once brought to the developers' attention, they'll
04:48
obviously want to fix them as quickly as possible.
04:51
The best way to protect yourself from zero-day
04:53
vulnerabilities is to keep your software updated.
04:56
When a zero-day vulnerability is
04:57
announced, patch it as quickly as possible.
05:00
Keeping up with the vastness of known
05:01
vulnerabilities is also a monumental task.
05:04
Fortunately, there's some help
05:05
available for network administrators.
05:08
The National Institute of Standards and
05:10
Technology, or NIST, has a publication that serves
05:13
as a national database of known vulnerabilities.
05:16
In addition, they provide vulnerability metrics called
05:18
the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS.
05:22
The NIST website states that CVSS is an open
05:26
framework for communicating the characteristics
05:28
and severity of software vulnerabilities.
05:31
After evaluating known vulnerabilities, CVSS
05:34
produces a score from zero to ten, letting
05:37
you calculate the vulnerability's severity.
05:39
This score helps you determine
05:40
the best course of action to take.
05:43
Another method of knowing about vulnerabilities
05:45
is to use the Common Vulnerabilities and
05:47
Exposures system, or CVE system.
05:50
The system's goal is to make it easier to share information
05:52
about known vulnerabilities across organizations.
05:56
This is done by creating unique, standardized CVE
05:58
identifiers to let you access information about specific
06:01
cyber threats across multiple information sources.
06:05
You can download CVE lists in several different formats.
06:08
As of the writing of this lesson, there are
06:10
well over 175,000 identified vulnerabilities.
8. Summary
06:14
That's it for this lesson.
06:16
In this lesson, we discussed the need for
06:18
enterprises to protect their infrastructure.
06:20
Some best practices to ensure protection
06:22
are to not use outdated firmware, default
06:24
configurations, or weak security settings.
06:27
Additionally, systems administrators need to make
06:30
sure that software patches are applied in a timely
06:32
manner and that bad credential management practices,
06:35
like discretionary credentials, are avoided.
06:38
Since securing physical access points is critical
06:40
to an organization's survival, you must have an
06:43
airtight infrastructure in place to do this.
06:45
Finally, we talked about a few resources
06:47
available to help you catalog and identify
06:49
common vulnerabilities and exposures.
