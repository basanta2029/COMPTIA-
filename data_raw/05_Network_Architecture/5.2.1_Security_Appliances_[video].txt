1. Security Appliances
00:03
In network security, many appliances are
00:05
available to help secure your network.
00:08
The size, needs, and resources of your
00:10
organization will be factors in determining
00:12
which ones to implement for your network.
00:15
In this lesson, we'll look at a few of these options.<br>
2. Proxy Servers
00:18
Let's start with proxy servers.
00:20
A proxy is a person who has the authority
00:22
to act on behalf of another person.<br>
00:25
Similarly, a proxy server acts on behalf of a client or
00:29
user when attempting to access resources over the internet.
00:33
The proxy server, in this position of an intermediary,
00:36
provides a layer of protection to the client.
00:40
A proxy server works on a store-and-forward model.
00:43
This means the proxy deconstructs each packet, performs
00:47
analysis, then rebuilds the packet and forwards it on if
00:51
it conforms to the rules it's been configured with.<br>
00:54
The main benefit of a proxy is that client computers connect
00:57
to a specified point on the perimeter network for web access.
01:02
This provides a degree of traffic management and security.
01:05
Proxy servers can also provide anonymity
01:08
for users by masking their IP addresses.
01:11
In addition, most web proxy servers provide caching engines;
01:15
the proxy retains frequently requested web pages, eliminating
01:19
the need to re-fetch those pages for subsequent requests.<br>
01:23
Proxy servers are also often used
01:25
for content filtering and monitoring.
01:28
They can block certain websites or filter out
01:30
malicious content before it reaches the client.
01:33
Proxy servers can even distribute incoming network traffic
01:37
across multiple servers, helping to balance the load and
01:40
improve the overall performance and reliability of a network.<br>
3. Jump Servers
01:44
The next appliance is a jump server.
01:47
A jump server is a hardened server
01:49
that provides access to other hosts.
01:51
Jump servers are often used for administrative tasks, where
01:55
administrators connect to the jump server first and then use
01:58
it to access other internal systems, like servers or devices.<br>
02:03
A jump server is primarily used to enhance security
02:06
by controlling access to sensitive resources.
02:10
It acts as a gateway to access certain systems
02:12
kept isolated from the external network.
02:15
The jump server is typically locked down and
02:18
secured to a higher degree, ensuring that only
02:21
authorized users can access it, reducing the
02:24
risk of unauthorized access to critical systems.<br>
4. Load Balancers
02:28
Now, let's talk about load balancers.
02:29
While primarily used to distribute network traffic across
02:33
multiple servers to optimize performance, a load balancer
02:37
can also serve as a security appliance in certain scenarios.
02:41
A load balancer distributes client requests
02:44
across available server nodes in a farm or pool.
02:48
This is used to provision services that can
02:51
scale from light to heavy loads and to provide
02:54
mitigation against denial-of-service attacks.<br>
02:57
A load balancer also provides fault tolerance.
03:00
When there are several servers in a farm, all
03:03
identified by a single name or IP address via a load
03:06
balancer, if one server stops working, client requests
03:10
can be sent to another server in the same group.<br>
03:13
A load balancer can be deployed in any situation where
03:17
there are multiple servers providing the same function.
03:20
Examples include web servers, front-end email servers,
03:24
web conferencing, and streaming media servers.<br>
03:27
There are two main types of load
03:29
balancers: layer 4 and layer 7.
03:32
A layer 4 load balancer makes forwarding
03:34
decisions on IP address and TCP/UPD port values,
03:39
working at the transport layer of the OSI model.
03:42
A layer 7 load balancer, or content switch, makes forwarding
03:47
decisions based on application-level data, such as a request
03:50
for a particular URL web address or data types like video or
03:54
audio streaming, which requires more complex logic.<br>
03:58
Load balancers can also include a Web
04:00
Application Firewall that provides protection
04:03
against common web application attacks.
04:06
Modern load balancers often include features
04:09
for traffic inspection and filtering.
04:11
They can analyze incoming traffic for suspicious patterns,
04:15
such as unusual request rates or malicious payloads.
04:18
Traffic from potentially harmful sources can
04:21
be dropped or redirected for further analysis.<br>
5. Sensors
04:25
Another network security appliance is a packet
04:27
sniffer, which is referred to as a sensor.
04:30
Typically, the packet capture sensor is placed behind a
04:33
firewall or close to a server of particular importance.
04:38
The idea is to identify malicious traffic
04:40
that has managed to get past the firewall.
04:43
A single sniffer can record a large amount of traffic
04:45
data, so don't put multiple sensors all over the network
04:49
without provisioning the resources to manage them properly.
04:52
Depending on network size and resources, one
04:55
or only a few sensors are typically deployed
04:57
to monitor key assets or network paths.<br>
05:01
The traffic captured by each sensor is transferred
05:04
to a host or appliance running an intrusion detection
05:07
system, or IDS, such as Snort, Suricata, or Zeek.
05:12
When traffic matches a detection signature,
05:15
the IDS raises an alert or generates a log
05:18
entry but does not block the source host.
05:21
This type of passive sensor doesn't slow down
05:24
traffic and is undetectable by the attacker.<br>
05:28
An IDS is used to identify and log hosts and
05:31
applications and to detect password-guessing attempts,
05:35
port scans, worms, backdoor applications, malformed
05:39
packets or sessions, and other policy violations.<br>
6. All-In-One Security Appliance: UTM
05:45
The last appliance we'll look at in this
05:46
lesson is an all-in-one security appliance.
05:49
An all-in-one security appliance incorporates multiple
05:52
security functions into a single piece of hardware.<br>
05:56
Unified Threat Management, or UTM, is
05:59
the most common all-in-one appliance.
06:02
UTM puts several key security components into a
06:05
single device, usually managed using a web interface.<br>
06:09
Let's look at some of the functionality commonly
06:11
implemented in all-in-one security devices.
06:14
One of the first features is URL filtering,
06:17
which prevents users from accessing URL
06:20
categories restricted by the organization.
06:23
These often include pornographic,
06:25
shopping, and gambling sites.<br>
06:28
Another feature is content inspection.
06:30
This helps to ensure that HTTP connections
06:33
and content meet certain criteria.
06:36
For example, many content filters actively monitor
06:38
data streams by inspecting the packets in search of
06:41
viruses, Trojans, worms, and other malicious code.<br>
06:46
These devices also include a spam filter
06:48
to reduce the chance that your users'
06:50
mailboxes will fill up with junk email.
06:53
The UTM will also probably include a firewall so you can
06:56
set up rules and log traffic to and from the network.
07:00
Many devices include an integrated intrusion
07:02
detection or prevention system that alerts you if
07:06
a network attack attempt is detected or prevented.<br>
7. UTM: Integrated Network Features
07:08
An all-in-one device typically contains
07:11
networking features as well as UTM features.
07:15
These network features include an integrated switch.
07:18
For small and remote offices that only have a
07:20
handful of systems, a small integrated switch
07:23
provides all the connectivity required.
07:26
As part of switching, the device may include
07:28
a network router that allows you to connect
07:30
to a network backbone using an uplink port.<br>
07:34
The device may also support traffic shaping to
07:37
prioritize one type of traffic over another.
07:40
For example, if the organization is using voice-over
07:42
IP phones, the all-in-one appliance can give voice
07:46
traffic priority over normal data traffic.<br>
8. Summary
07:50
And that's it for this lesson.
07:52
In this lesson, we discussed a
07:53
few security appliance options.
07:55
First, we talked about proxy servers and how they work
07:58
as middlemen between clients and internet resources.
08:01
Then, we looked at jump servers that are used
08:04
to control access to sensitive resources.
08:07
Then, we reviewed load balancers and
08:09
what role they can play in security.
08:11
After that, we looked at sensors and how they record
08:14
traffic data and supply that information to an IDS, which
08:18
flags anything with a matching detection signature.
08:21
We ended this lesson by discussing an all-in-one security
08:24
appliance called a Unified Threat Management appliance,
08:28
which can combine multiple devices into one appliance.<br>
