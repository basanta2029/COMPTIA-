1. Configuring a VPN Client
00:02
In this demonstration, we're going to create a
00:05
client VPN connection on a Windows 10 system.<br>
2. Configure VPN
00:08
There's VPN software built into
00:10
Windows 10 that works really well.
00:12
We're going to go down to the Start
00:14
button and choose the Settings option.
00:17
Inside the Settings option, notice that there's
00:19
a category for Network and Internet, and inside
00:23
of this category, there's a node for VPN.
00:26
We can create a VPN connection, and we can choose
00:29
to allow this VPN connection over metered networks.<br>
00:32
This means if we're connecting, maybe via
00:34
cellular, and this is going to be a charge per
00:37
gigabyte of data that we transfer, we're going
00:40
to permit the VPN over this type of connection.
00:42
We'll also permit the VPN while we're roaming with the
00:46
system by default, so we'll choose the add a VPN connection
00:50
button, and then we can choose the VPN provider.<br>
00:54
Let's say that we're using the built-in functionality
00:57
of VPNs with Windows as our VPN provider, and we're
01:00
going to say this is 'CorpNetVPN'.
01:03
Then we'll provide the IP address or the fully
01:06
qualified domain name as long as it's registered
01:09
in your DNS system for the VPN server.
01:12
This is typically information that you're
01:13
going to provide your end users so that they
01:15
can successfully make the VPN connection.<br>
01:18
For the VPN type, often, we'll configure it to
01:22
be automatic, and we'll have given the
01:24
instructions to this client for how to connect.
01:27
But notice you can also configure it
01:29
so that it's preset for the VPN type.
01:32
A popular option here is IKE version 2.
01:35
This would be used with IPSec VPN connections, for example.<br>
01:39
You can easily use a smart card, a one-time password, a
01:42
certificate, or a username and password for verification.
01:45
We'll do a dfellows username and
01:48
a password that's extra strong.
01:53
Once the correct information is entered, we'll
01:55
save it, and now have a CorpNet VPN connection.
02:00
We can connect at any time we'd like, or we
02:03
could go in the advanced options and edit the
02:05
properties of this connection, clear the sign-in
02:08
info, or specify that we need to use a VPN proxy.
02:13
This is a device we'd go to for
02:15
establishing the VPN on our behalf.<br>
3. Remove VPN
02:17
We can easily remove any VPN connection that we've
02:21
created inside of this settings area, provided that we
02:24
have the appropriate permissions inside of Windows 10.<br>
4. Summary
02:27
That's it for this demo.
02:29
We discussed how easy it is to establish
02:31
a VPN connection inside of Windows 10.<br>
