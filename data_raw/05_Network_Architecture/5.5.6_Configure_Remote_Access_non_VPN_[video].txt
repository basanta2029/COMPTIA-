1. Configure Remote Access, non-VPN
00:04
Remote access is a method that allows you to connect
00:07
to a computer remotely from another computer.
00:09
This could be useful if you're logging into your
00:11
computer at home while you're away, helping a family
00:14
member, or just requiring access to a server.
00:17
Some of you may be familiar with a VPN,
00:19
which stands for Virtual Private Network.
00:22
This is another means of connecting to a remote
00:24
network when you're physically not there.
00:27
These connections require more knowledge to set up,
00:29
but the non-VPN method we're showing you today doesn't.<br>
2. Setting up the Connection
00:33
To get started, we'll open our web browser
00:35
and type in remotedesktop.google.com.
00:38
We'd like to access my computer,
00:40
so let's click on this option here.
00:42
You'll be required to have a Google account.
00:44
We already have one, so we're just going to log in.
00:47
First, we need to provide our email,
00:49
and after that, input our password.
00:52
We're not worried about saving the password or this
00:54
extra pop-up down here, so we'll make these go away.
00:58
On the left-hand side, we have three options:
01:00
Remote Access, Remote Support, and Set up via SSH.
01:05
Remote Access is for accessing
01:06
another PC, something you'd set up.
01:09
Remote Support would be for helping someone else, where
01:12
they'd need to download a link and provide you with a code.
01:15
The third option is to set up an SSH
01:17
connection to a Windows or Linux Computer.<br>
01:21
We're going to walk through the setup for remote access.
01:24
First, we must ensure we're on the computer requiring
01:27
remote access and then download this link here.
01:30
It will download an extension that can be used by both
01:33
Chrome and Edge, as they're built on the same platform.
01:37
It may take a bit for this to download,
01:38
so we're going to fast-forward.
01:41
Now, you can see the MSI file is downloaded.
01:44
All we have to do is click Accept &amp; Install.
01:47
This will start the installation process.
01:50
The window should pop up to show us
01:51
where the MSI file was downloaded.
01:54
Once executed, it will prompt to close some
01:56
applications before it can be installed.
01:59
Our install is done, so we can close this window.<br>
02:02
Now that we have Chrome Remote Desktop
02:04
installed, we can name the PC we are setting up.
02:07
By default, it grabs the hostname of the computer.
02:10
If your hostname wasn't set up previously, you may see a mix
02:12
of letters and numbers instead of Office-PC like this one.
02:16
We're going to click Next.
02:18
For security purposes, you'll be required to set up a PIN.
02:21
I'm going to set this and then confirm it for a second time.
02:25
After clicking Start, we should be able to accept one final
02:28
UAC prompt, and then our Office-PC should be ready to go.
02:32
You'll notice it says Offline; however, when
02:35
you refresh the web browser, it's now Online.
02:38
Now, let's try connecting to this PC from another PC.<br>
3. Connecting to a Remote Computer
02:42
Okay, we're on our other PC where
02:43
Chrome Remote Desktop isn't installed.
02:46
Let's navigate to remotedesktop.google.com
02:49
and click Access my computer.
02:52
Login with your previously set up credentials.
02:55
Once done, we'll see the main
02:56
screen for our remote desktop menu.
02:58
In the middle, you can see the computer
03:00
we just set up for remote access.
03:02
Let's give it a go and select it.
03:05
After that, you'll be prompted for a PIN.
03:07
You can choose to remember it on this
03:08
device; however, if you're focused on
03:11
security, you can choose not to remember it.<br>
03:14
Great, it looks like our remote connection worked.
03:16
We have access to the desktop and can do everything
03:18
on it just like you'd be sitting at this desk, whether
03:21
it's just surfing the internet or even launching
03:23
different applications, like system information.<br>
4. Summary
03:26
That's it for this demo.
03:28
In this demo, we showed you how you can leverage a way
03:30
to connect to your PC remotely without using a VPN.<br>
