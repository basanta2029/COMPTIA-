1. Detect Malicious Network Traffic with a Honeypot
00:04
Reconnaissance tools like nmap can find
00:06
vulnerable systems on the internet.
00:08
These tools scan ranges of IP addresses for
00:10
systems with interesting ports open, such as
00:13
Telnet, Remote Desktop, SSH, and FTP.
00:17
Many ethical hackers like to know who's
00:19
gathering this kind of information, and there's
00:21
a simple way to record reconnaissance attempts.
00:23
In order to record these network scans, we need a computer
00:26
whose sole purpose is to listen for connection attempts on
00:29
interesting ports, then log the data about each attempt.
00:33
This kind of system is called a honeypot.
00:36
It looks appealing and hackable from the
00:37
outside, but it's actually recording data about
00:40
every remote user that attempts to connect.
00:43
Today, we'll look at how to set up an extremely
00:45
basic honeypot using a tool called Pentbox.
2. Pentbox
00:47
Pentbox is available online, but many people
00:51
upload copies of the original program.
00:53
When downloading tools, especially hacking tools,
00:56
you have to be certain of the tool's integrity so
00:59
you don't download malicious software.
01:01
I've already downloaded the tool and put it in
01:03
a folder named pentbox, so let's open that now.
01:07
From my Kali Linux machine, I'll open a
01:09
terminal and navigate to 'cd pentbox/'.
01:11
I'll list the folder's contents
01:13
to make sure everything is there.
01:15
Pentbox is a Ruby script.
01:17
Since Ruby is already installed on
01:19
Kali, we just need to run the script.
01:21
To do that, I'll type './pentbox.rb' and press Enter.
01:25
When it opens, we can see a variety of options.
01:28
Pentbox does a lot of things.
01:29
But right now, we're only interested in the honeypot
01:32
utility, which is located under Network Tools.
01:35
First, I'll select number 2, and
01:37
then we'll select Honeypot, number 3.
01:40
After we've selected the Honeypot utility, we're presented
01:42
with the option to use either fast or manual configuration.
01:46
I'm going to select number 1, the Fast
01:48
Autoconfiguration option, since the manual configuration
01:52
only lets us change which port the tool listens on.
01:55
It also lets us set the message to
01:57
return to the requesting machine.
02:00
As soon as we press Enter, we're told that
02:03
the honeypot has started running on port 80.
02:05
Let's try connecting to it with Firefox to see what happens.
02:10
I'll open Firefox and type 'localhost' in the address bar.
02:15
We can see that the honeypot returns back a
02:17
web page that tells us access has been denied.
02:21
Interestingly, the autoconfiguration
02:22
option returns a line with a date and time.
02:25
This doesn't change; actually, it
02:28
represents the time the tool was started.
02:30
Now that we've connected to the
02:32
page, let's see what Pentbox says.
02:33
Okay, I'm back on my Kali Linux system.
02:36
It looks like the honeypot utility is
02:37
telling us quite a bit of information.
02:39
The first line of each entry shows that there was a
02:42
connection attempt and tells us what the IP address of the
02:45
connecting machine was, as well as the connection time.
02:49
After that, the honeypot utility tells us the header
02:52
information that was received when the connection was made.
02:55
This information includes both the web
02:57
browser that was used and information about
02:59
the type of operating system that connected.
3. Summary
03:02
So, there's a really simple
03:04
overview of a honeypot's function.
03:06
This is just a taste of what you can accomplish- there
03:08
are many more robust tools available that can log
03:11
information about connections on many different ports
03:14
and protocols simultaneously, which is a goldmine of
03:17
data that will help you keep your network safe.
