1. Enterprise Network Architecture
00:04
In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of network
00:07
design, from architecture decisions to device placement.
00:10
Let's get started!<br>
2. Network Architecture
00:14
Network architecture is like the blueprint of a network.
00:17
It involves choosing and arranging components such as
00:20
media, devices, protocols or services, and data assets.
00:24
Within this framework, we have network
00:26
infrastructure, which consists of the physical
00:28
elements like cables, appliances, and addressing and
00:31
forwarding protocols that enable basic connectivity.<br>
00:35
Network applications are the services running on
00:37
this infrastructure to support business activities
00:40
like processing invoices or sending emails.
00:43
Data assets are the information generated
00:46
as a result of these activities.<br>
00:49
The goal of secure network infrastructure and
00:51
application architecture is to support secure
00:54
business workflows, where security means ensuring
00:56
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.<br>
01:00
Let's take the example of provisioning email services
01:03
to understand the architecture decisions involved.<br>
01:07
Access control ensures that client devices
01:09
access the network through a secure channel
01:12
with authentication and authorization.
01:15
Unauthorized users and devices must be denied access.<br>
01:19
The email mailbox server stores data assets securely
01:22
and must be accessible only to authorized clients.
01:26
It should also be fault-tolerant and highly available.<br>
01:29
The mail transfer server, responsible for connecting with
01:32
untrusted internet hosts, requires careful control to manage
01:36
communications between the untrusted network and trusted LAN.
01:41
Any data or software leaving or entering the
01:43
network must be subject to policy-based controls.<br>
01:47
This type of business flow will involve
01:48
systems with different security requirements.
01:51
Placing the client, the mailbox, and the
01:53
mail transfer server all within the same
01:56
segment will introduce many vulnerabilities.
01:59
Understanding and controlling how data flows
02:01
between these network segments is a key part of
02:04
secure and effective network architecture design.<br>
3. Network Infrastructure and the OSI Model
02:10
Now, let's dive into network infrastructure using the
02:13
OSI model, a framework for understanding network layers.<br>
02:17
At the physical layer (Layer 1), we find various
02:20
transmission media, from cables to wireless signals,
02:23
which are the links connecting network nodes.
02:25
Now, nodes come in two types:<br>
02:28
host nodes, which initiate data transfers
02:30
(like servers or clients), and intermediary
02:33
nodes that forward traffic around the network.<br>
02:36
Networks can vary in scope, from local area networks
02:40
(LANs) for a single site to wide area networks (WANs)
02:43
that span metropolitan, country-wide, or global scopes.<br>
02:47
Each network node must have a unique address, and this
02:51
addressing function occurs at different layers and scopes.<br>
02:54
Various network appliances and protocols handle forwarding
02:58
and addressing functions, such as switches, routers,
03:01
transport protocols, application protocols, and DNS servers.<br>
4. Architecture Considerations
03:09
When designing a network, several factors come into play.
03:12
Costs, including upfront investments and
03:14
ongoing maintenance, need to be considered.
03:17
Compute resources affect processing
03:19
time for various workloads.
03:21
Scalability and ease of deployment
03:24
help manage changes in workload.
03:26
Availability and resilience minimize downtime
03:29
and recovery time in case of failures.
03:31
Facility power usage capabilities and patch availability
03:36
are also vital considerations, along with the option of
03:39
risk transference through service-level agreements.
03:42
These factors together shape the
03:44
architecture of your network.<br>
5. Device Placement and Security Controls
03:50
The selection of effective controls for network
03:52
infrastructure is the process of choosing the type
03:55
and placement of security appliances and software.
03:59
The aim is to enforce segmentation, apply access
04:02
controls, and monitor traffic for policy violations.<br>
04:07
Guided by the principle of defense in
04:08
depth, diverse controls are placed at
04:11
different OSI layers to enhance security.<br>
04:13
You have three options: preventive controls at
04:16
network borders, detective controls within the
04:18
perimeter, and a combination of preventive,
04:22
detective, and corrective controls on hosts.
04:25
For instance, a firewall at the network border enforces
04:29
access rules, while a sensor behind it relays traffic to
04:32
an intrusion detection system for monitoring.
04:35
Access control lists on internal routers enforce
04:38
rules for traffic between zones, and load balancers
04:42
can help mitigate denial-of-service attacks.<br>
04:45
Endpoint protection software on hosts adds another layer
04:48
of security, implementing host firewalls, anti-virus,
04:52
intrusion detection, and data loss prevention.<br>
6. Device Attributes
04:59
Lastly, attributes determine the precise way in which
05:02
a device can be placed within the network topology.<br>
05:05
Controls can be active or passive.
05:08
Active controls require configuration and data
05:10
exchange, while passive controls operate silently.<br>
05:14
Deployment can be inline, becoming part of the network path,
05:18
or as taps or monitors, capturing traffic transparently.
05:23
The router/firewall is an active control as client
05:26
devices must be configured to use it for internet access.
05:30
The TAP and mirror ports are passive controls.
05:33
They're completely transparent
05:34
to the server and client hosts.<br>
7. Summary
05:40
That's it for this lesson.
05:41
In this lesson, we discussed network architecture
05:44
and how it's the blueprint of your network design.
05:47
We then talked about how the network infrastructure
05:49
fits within the architecture framework.
05:52
We used the OSI model to help us understand how
05:54
different components of the infrastructure fit together.
05:58
Next, we reviewed the many architecture
06:00
considerations that factor into your network design.
06:03
We also discussed device placement and security controls.
06:07
We finished this lesson by looking at device attributes that
06:10
determine how a security control affects device placement.<br>
