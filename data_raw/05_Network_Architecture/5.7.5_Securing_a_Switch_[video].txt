1. Securing a Switch
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to
00:06
secure access to our network switch.
00:08
We're using a Cisco Small Business Switch, which
00:11
has a web interface for access and configuration.
00:13
We access the switch by typing its IP
00:16
address, 192.168.254.8, into a web browser.
00:18
And here's the login page.
00:20
This is a new switch, so it still has the default
00:23
user name and password configured of cisco and
00:26
cisco, which we'll enter and then click Log In.
2. Login as the Default User
00:29
Now, the default user name and password for this
00:32
device can be found very easily, so you can tell
00:34
that this switch is not very secure right now.
00:37
Normally, the first thing you should do with a new network
00:40
device is change the default user name and password.
3. Create a New User
00:43
On this device, we can use the Change Device
00:45
Password link under Quick Access to do this.
00:48
This takes us directly to the User
00:50
Accounts page under Administration.
00:52
And here's the default user, cisco.
00:55
Let's first create another user.
00:57
Click Add.
00:58
Enter ciscoAdmin for the user name.
01:01
Enter a strong, complex password.
01:10
And we want Read/Write Management Access.
01:13
And click Apply.
01:17
And we can see the new ciscoAdmin user here.
01:21
We also want to change the password for the default user.
01:23
So we'll select the cisco user and click Edit.
01:30
And again we want to use a complex password.
01:35
And for this user, let's also change the user level.
01:39
We'll select Read-Only CLI Access.
4. Change the Default User's Password and User Level
01:42
This way, if someone is able to get into the switch using
01:45
the default account, they won't be able to change anything.
01:48
And we'll click Apply.
01:50
So, the first thing we've done to secure access
01:52
to our switch is add another admin account with
01:55
a custom user name and a complex password.
01:58
We then changed the default user's password
02:00
and set the user level to read-only.
02:03
Doing this makes it harder for people to get into
02:05
our switch here and change the configuration.
02:08
And this should be the first step
02:09
you do with any new network device.
5. Save Changes to the Startup Configuration Files
02:12
Now, there's one more important step to take here.
02:15
And that's to save the changes we've to the startup config.
02:19
If we don't, as soon as the switch is rebooted,
02:21
the changes will be lost; we don't want this.
02:24
So we'll click Save to go to the
02:26
Copy/Save Configuration page.
02:28
And here we want to save the contents of the
02:30
Running configuration to the Startup configuration.
02:33
And click Apply.
02:34
Now when the device reboots, it
02:36
will load our custom configuration.
6. Summary
02:38
That's it for this demonstration.
02:40
In this demo, we secured access to our network switch.
02:43
First we added a new management user with full access.
02:47
We changed the default user's password.
02:49
And then we saved our changes to
02:50
the startup configuration file.
