1. Attack Deception
00:04
In this lesson we'll discuss attack deceptions.
00:06
By now you should have a clear understanding
00:09
of what an attack is and what it looks like.
00:11
Threat agents are working hard to
00:13
find weaknesses in your defenses.
00:14
They will exploit any vulnerability to gather
00:17
information from an organization's network system.
00:20
Knowing this, organizations can set up data
00:22
or add devices to their networks that lures
00:24
unsuspecting attackers into attacking devices.
00:28
The attacking devices are designed to trap attackers and
00:31
prevent them from exfiltrating any useful information.
2. Honeypots
00:34
The first item we'll look at is the honeypot.
00:37
As the name implies, if you look inside,
00:39
you'll find will find something sweet.
00:41
A honeypot is a network set up to fool an attacker
00:44
into thinking he's attacking a network device critical
00:46
to your company; however, it's simply a ruse.
00:49
The attacker can attack the honeypot as long
00:52
as he wants and get as deep as he wants;
00:54
however, there is no prize or honey in the end.
00:57
A honeypot can be a host, a service on a host, a
01:00
network device, a virtual entity, or even a single
01:04
file set up to attract attackers to a secure area
01:07
away from an organization's real network.
01:10
Even better, while it's distracting the
01:11
attacker, you can monitor the malicious activity
01:15
to learn what the attacker is trying to do.
01:17
For example, if an attacker attempts an exploit or upload a
01:21
rootkit or Trojan to a server, the honeypot environment will
01:25
safely store those files for malware collection and analysis.
01:29
There are several types of honeypots that are
01:31
designed to mimic and trap different types of attacks.
01:34
Each honeypot falls into one of two
01:36
categories: research or production.
01:39
Research honeypots are typically used by research,
01:41
military, or government organizations to gather information
01:44
about the motives and tactics of the attackers.
01:47
They are also used for educational purposes.
01:50
Production honeypots are used, primarily
01:52
by private and public organizations.
01:54
Let's look at a few examples of production honeypots.
01:57
First, you have the SSH honeypots.
01:59
SSH honeypots are designed to trap brute force attacks
02:02
that attempt to guess the password of a targeted device.
02:05
Perhaps more importantly, this type of honeypot captures
02:08
the complete shell history performed by the attacker.
02:12
Next, we have HTTP honeypots.
02:14
This type of honeypot is used to trap different
02:16
types of web vulnerabilities such as SQL injections,
02:19
file insertions, and web application attacks.
02:22
We also have WordPress honeypots which are
02:25
designed to attract spam and adware attacks.
02:27
An email honeypot is used to attract SMTP-based
02:31
attacks such as open relay, DDoS, and spam attacks.
02:35
And lastly, there are several types of honeypots
02:37
designed for TCP/IP-based protocol attacks.
3. Honeynets and Honeyfiles
02:41
To make things more enticing to the attackers,
02:43
many companies will create a decoy network and
02:45
fill it with one or more honeypots.
02:47
This is known as a honeynet.
02:49
The information gained from a honeynet attack serves to
02:52
strengthen an organization's defense against future attack.
02:56
Similar in concept to a honeypot, a honeyfile is
02:59
a single file setup to entice and trap attackers
03:02
and to figure out what they're trying to do.
03:04
These types of files are typically set up on a
03:06
file server, and when accessed, an alarm is set
03:09
off notifying that administrators of the attack.
03:12
These types of alarms are often sent by email
03:14
directly to the user, which can also be easily
03:17
seen on a phone and almost instantly interpreted.
03:20
Honeyfiles are named so the hacker
03:21
will try and open or execute them.
03:24
For example, files with names such as passwords.txt
03:27
or IP Assignments.xls are prized targets for hackers
03:32
to gain useful information about a user or system.
03:35
When it comes to honeyfiles, attackers are
03:37
typically interested in four types of files.
03:40
First, are the informational files.
03:41
These are the types of files that contain information about
03:44
access other systems, like a password.txt file, and security
03:48
files like Microsoft word file named vpn_instructions.
03:52
The second type are application or program
03:54
files that an attacker may run, but the
03:57
normal user wouldn't, such as a complier.
03:59
Third, hackers love to attack files that
04:02
contain evidence of an attack such as log files.
04:04
The last type of file commonly targeted by attackers are
04:08
files that might contain intellectual property such as a
04:11
forecast, credit card numbers, and product roadmaps.
04:15
As you can see, honeyfiles protect a wide variety of
04:17
files and systems including email and email attachments.
04:21
Although we've pointed out the four major
04:22
types of file that attack hackers, keep in
04:25
mind that any file can be used as a honeyfile.
04:29
Honeyfiles also work with network intrusion detection
04:31
systems, or NIDS, and help to prevent false positives.
04:35
The other nice thing about honeyfiles is that if end
04:38
users are properly trained, they can create their own
04:41
honeyfiles and set up their own alarms and alerts.
04:44
Enabling users makes the detection process
04:46
easy and deployment effectiveness is high.
04:49
Since users create their own honeyfiles,
04:51
they receive the alarm if they accidentally
04:53
access one of their own monitored files.
04:55
This virtually eliminates false
04:57
positives that have be investigated.
04:59
This saves time, effort, and energy for system
05:02
management charged with keeping the network secure.
05:05
Further, this process supports a defense-in-depth strategy.
4. DNS Sinkhole
05:08
Now let's shift gears and discuss DNS sinkholes.
05:12
Simply put, a DNS sinkhole is used to
05:14
provide false information for DNS queries.
05:17
Although this may sound counterintuitive, providing
05:19
false information can help to prevent a denial-of-service
05:22
or distributed denial-of-service attack.
05:25
DNS sinkholes are an effective measure that blocks
05:28
malicious traffic and blocks bots from successfully
05:30
taking a site down using a DDoS attack.
05:33
It's important to understand that
05:35
a DNS sinkhole is not a product.
05:37
Instead, it's a method used by system management
05:39
to fool an attacker by providing bogus information.
05:43
For example, suppose a bot attempts
05:45
to use DNS to forward information.
05:47
The DNS server returns fake information and
05:49
the bot can't continue its malicious activity.
05:52
As another example, supposed an attacker sends
05:55
a malicious email to an unsuspecting user.
05:57
Should the user click the link in the email,
05:59
the DNS sinkhole would prevent the attack by
06:01
resolving the DNS query to a false site.
06:04
Creating a DNS sinkhole is not without its limitations.
06:07
To work correctly, the malware must
06:09
use the organization's DNS server.
06:11
If it uses a public DNS server or
06:13
its own DNS server, this won't work.
06:16
You can mitigate this by configuring firewalls
06:18
to block DNS queries going outside the perimeter.
06:21
It's also important to understand that a sinkhole
06:23
doesn't prevent malware and can't prevent malware
06:26
execution or remove malware from the system.
06:29
However, the DNS server will be
06:31
configured with potential malware sites.
06:33
Creating a sinkhole can take time.
06:35
Even if obtained from trusted internet sources, its possible
06:38
legitimate sites are used to forward malicious content.
06:41
This could result in restrictions to legitimate websites.
06:44
Therefore, sinkholes should be internal only.
06:47
If attackers can access the DNS server externally, they can
06:50
change entries in the sinkhole and use it to their benefit.
5. Fake Telemetry
06:53
While many threat agents are looking for open and
06:56
available vulnerabilities, others are looking to
06:59
infiltrate a network's defenses and either copy
07:01
intellectual property or damage internal systems.
07:04
It's truly a cat and mouse game played
07:06
by attackers and network managers.
07:08
Attackers are always trying new techniques to perform their
07:11
reconnaissance and discover weakness they can exploit.
07:14
One method used by system managers
07:16
is the concept of fake telemetry.
07:18
Telemetry is defined as the collection of data
07:20
at remote points and their automatic transmission
07:23
to receiving equipment for monitoring.
07:25
As such, organizations provide false
07:28
data, meant to deceive the attacker.
07:30
This type of fake information might include
07:32
fake credentials or fake IP address information.
07:34
It might be an internal report detailing vulnerable
07:37
systems that require updates when, they are really
07:39
honeypots designed to capture attacker information.
07:43
The primary reason for providing fake information is
07:45
to get the attacker to act on the false information.
07:48
Since the information is controlled by system
07:50
managers, they can utilize alerts, alarms, and logs to
07:53
track the techniques and tools used by an attacker.
07:56
The tracked information allows system
07:58
management to tune perimeter equipment such as
08:01
firewalls, NIDS, NIPS and other protections.
6. Summary
08:05
That's it for this lesson.
08:06
In this video, we discussed deception techniques used
08:09
by companies to protect themselves from attackers.
08:12
We discussed such techniques as using honeypots,
08:14
honeyfiles, and honeynets to lure attackers into fake areas.
08:18
We also discussed the benefits of using DNS sinkholes.
08:22
And we ended this lesson outlining the
08:23
benefits of companies using fake telemetry.
