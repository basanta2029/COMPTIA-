1. Application Control
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going
00:06
to look at application control.
00:08
Application controls focus on controlling the applications
00:12
a user at a workstation can access over a network.
00:15
This is similar to what a firewall does.
00:17
For example, a packet filtering firewall
00:20
examines traffic going through it.
00:22
Based on its rule set, a firewall will block traffic
00:25
using specific ports or protocols, so you should be
00:28
able to control application access with a firewall.
00:32
However, if you have a savvy user trying to
00:34
access a forbidden application on the internet,
00:37
the user can reconfigure the session to use a
00:39
protocol or port that is commonly left open on
00:42
most network firewalls, for example, port 80.
00:45
A user could reconfigure a game application
00:48
blocked by the firewall to use port 80.
00:51
The packet filtering firewall doesn't examine the contents
00:54
of the packet, only the protocol--TCP, UDP--and the port.
01:00
So, a firewall wouldn't block the game traffic
01:02
redirected to a port that's used for legitimate traffic.
01:06
Application control software, on the other
01:07
hand, focuses on the application signature.
01:11
In much the same way that antivirus software uses
01:13
signatures to detect viruses on your system, application
01:17
control software uses application signatures to identify
01:20
traffic associated with a specific application.
01:23
It disregards the port number used.
2. Configuring Application Control
01:26
In this demonstration, we're going to configure application
01:28
control software to block specific network applications.
01:32
To do this, we have our network set up similar to what is
01:35
shown in this picture here, with user computers accessing
01:39
the network through a shared switch--some wirelessly, some
01:41
wired--and ultimately passing through the firewall that
01:46
also has application control software configured on it, to
01:50
our router, and then out to the internet.
01:53
In other words, all traffic passes through here; and as
01:56
such, the application control software can look at those
01:59
packets before it allows entry or exit from the network.
02:02
For this demo, we'll be using the untangle software
02:07
that includes an application control module.
02:09
Certain aspects of this program are free.
02:11
You have to pay for the application control,
02:13
but you can try it out for free for 14 days.
02:17
You can click up here to see what
02:18
applications are currently installed.
02:20
You can see there's a variety of
02:22
applications or modules that they have.
02:25
We have captive portal, which requires, for
02:27
instance, users to accept a use agreement before
02:31
getting onto our network; there's a firewall; there
02:34
are some phishing blockers or virus protection.
02:37
We're interested in this application control.
02:41
Even though the application control is up and running
02:43
and turned on, it's actually not filtering much.
02:46
Before we can use it, we need to tell it
02:48
which applications we would like to filter.
3. Blocking Applications
02:51
In order to demonstrate this, before I
02:52
configure that, I want to show you that I have
02:56
access on a machine that's within my network.
02:57
I'm going to switch over to my Windows 10 machine now.
03:01
My Windows 10 machine is one of these computers over here.
03:05
Let's go look at it now.
03:07
As you can see, my Windows 10 machine
03:09
has access to the internet right now.
03:11
We can go out and do a Google search on
03:14
application controllers--or, in this case, a
03:16
Bing search--and you can see it returns results.
03:21
Perhaps I want to check Facebook and see
03:24
what's going on in my life, or I could pull up
03:28
Skype and start to chat my life away on Skype.
03:31
You can see that these applications are working.
03:35
Let's go ahead now and switch back to our
03:39
application control and enable some rules
03:41
to prohibit access to these services.
03:42
We'll come here to the Applications tab, and then
03:46
we need to go down and find those specific services.
03:48
You can see there's a wide variety
03:51
of services that are listed here.
03:52
I wish there was a better way to search for the
03:55
particular service that you're wanting to block.
03:56
For now, we'll have to be content with just scrolling down.
04:03
Look at the thousands, over 2000 different
04:05
applications, that you can block.
04:08
So, I find Facebook here and I'm
04:10
going to go ahead and block that.
04:12
I could also flag it so that it
04:14
ends up in one of my reports.
04:15
This Tarpit option right here, simply allows
04:19
the connection to be established, but then the
04:21
application control 'software untangle' drops
04:24
the information so that both sides think there's
04:27
a connection, but no data actually gets through.
04:29
We blocked Facebook.
04:31
Let's go ahead and scroll down and block Skype now.
04:35
There's lots of different Skype services.
04:37
I'm going to just block them all.
04:40
You can see that it's fairly granular
04:42
in what you can do, allow or prohibit.
04:46
Once you're done, then you need to click the Save button.
04:50
Unfortunately, the application doesn't scale well, so
04:52
you'll have to scroll down to get to that Save button.
04:56
There it is right there.
04:57
Once you've clicked that Save button, now those
04:59
applications and those rules will be enforced.
05:03
Let me now switch back over to my Windows 10
05:05
environment and see the impact of those rule changes.
05:09
Let's go ahead and try to refresh Facebook.
05:11
You'll notice that nothing works.
05:13
As we refresh Facebook, you see
05:15
that the page can't be reached.
05:17
However, other pages are still accessible,
05:21
and we can still do our search.
05:26
Let's go investigate Skype now.
05:30
You can see here that my contacts are no longer
05:33
online, and it's having trouble connecting over there.
05:40
Again, you can get pretty granular on what
05:42
you want to block and what you want to allow.
05:46
Let's switch back over to the untangle server now.
05:49
You can see how effective that was in blocking the traffic.
4. Reviewing results
05:53
We can go look and it monitors how many sessions are there.
05:58
Looks like it had 2500 scans and allowed 1700 of those.
06:05
It flagged 70 different applications, kept track of those.
06:09
You have kind of a dashboard around what it has done.
06:13
You can easily turn this on and
06:14
off by simply clicking right here.
06:17
And then if we switch back over to our Windows 10, you'll
06:19
see that all of a sudden I can now access Skype and Facebook.
06:23
Let's do that.
06:27
No problem.
06:31
And if we pull up Skype, you can see that it's back online.
06:35
Switching back over to our untangle server',
06:38
let's just look at a couple more things.
06:40
This first column is just the application signature.
06:43
You can see the name, the category.
06:47
This is nice because you can ban whole groups of
06:49
applications based on the type of category, or the presumed
06:53
productivity associated with that application, risk
06:55
associated with it, and then a short description of that.
07:03
There are others.
07:05
You can go look at the specific roles,
07:07
or you can view reports behind this.
07:10
So, once again, very easy to set up, but very
07:13
useful in helping to control your environment,
07:16
and what's going on within your enterprise.
5. Summary
07:19
That's it for this demonstration.
07:21
In this demo, we introduced you
07:23
to application control software.
07:25
We first talked about what
07:26
application control software does.
07:28
We then configured the untangle application control software
07:31
to block specific traffic--in this case, Skype and Facebook.
07:36
Then we went to the client system on the
07:38
internal network and we tried to access a
07:40
forbidden application and it was blocked.
