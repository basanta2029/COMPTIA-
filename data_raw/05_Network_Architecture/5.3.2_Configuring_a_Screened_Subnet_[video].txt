1. Configuring a Screened Subnet
00:04
In this demonstration, we're going to create a
00:07
screened subnet on our pfSense security appliance.
00:10
Be aware that screened subnets are also
00:12
referred to as demilitarized zones, or DMZs.
00:15
Often, you will see them referred to as DMZs
00:17
in software settings with various vendors.
00:20
So, if we encounter something listed as
00:22
DMZ, we are referring to a screened subnet.<br>
00:25
For our current configuration, our
00:27
device has two connections: LAN and WAN.
00:32
As mentioned earlier, we are here
00:33
to configure a screened subnet.
00:35
I have a few extra optional ports on my pfSense device, and
00:38
I'm going to configure one of these for the screened subnet.
00:41
I'll also assign it the IP address 172.16.1.1.
00:47
Let's get started.<br>
00:49
The first thing I'll do from our pfSense
00:51
Dashboard is confirm our current situation.
00:53
You can see here that I have WAN and LAN interfaces.
00:57
To add my screened subnet, I'll
00:58
go to Interfaces &gt; Assignments.
01:01
On the Interface Assignments
01:02
page, I'll click the Add button.<br>
2. Configure the Screened Subnet Interface
01:05
Here, I can see that OPT1 is displayed.
01:08
I'll go ahead and click on it.
01:10
OPT1 isn't a very descriptive name, so let's call it 'DMZ.'
01:14
Before I forget, I'll check the
01:16
box here to enable the interface.
01:19
For IPv4 Configuration Type, I'll
01:21
choose Static IPv4 from the list.
01:24
We won't configure IPv6 for this demo.
01:27
Now, let's scroll down to our Static IPv4 Configuration.
01:31
As per my diagram, I said I was going to assign it the
01:34
IP address '172.16.1.1,' so that's what I'll type in.
01:40
I want to give it a /24 subnet mask.<br>
01:46
That's all we need to do here.
01:47
Click Save.<br>
3. Configuring DHCP
01:50
Now we can see the changes in our interface.
01:52
It also says, "Don't forget to adjust the
01:54
DHCP Server range if needed after applying."
01:57
Let's go ahead and click on Apply Changes.<br>
02:01
Let's configure our DHCP Server for our screened subnet.
02:05
I'll go to Services &gt; DHCP Server.
02:08
We land on the page for the LAN DHCP Server.
02:12
Let's go to the DHCP Server for the screened subnet.<br>
02:16
I'll go ahead and enable DHCP for
02:18
our screened subnet interface.
02:20
Now we need to configure the range of IP
02:22
addresses that our DHCP will hand out.
02:25
I always leave IPs at the beginning of
02:27
the range open for static addresses.
02:30
I can pick something ending in .2 all the way up to .254.
02:34
I'll set it to '172.16.1.100' and end at '172.16.1.199'.
02:44
This way, I'll know that anything
02:45
in the 100s was assigned via DHCP.<br>
02:48
I'll scroll down and click Save.<br>
4. Verify Settings
02:52
Now let's go back to our dashboard and verify
02:54
that our screened subnet interface is showing up.
02:57
I'll scroll down, and right here, you
02:59
can see that we have our screened subnet.
03:02
This is where we can add devices to our screened
03:04
subnet and configure our firewall for handling
03:07
traffic going to and from the screened subnet.<br>
5. Summary
03:11
That's it for this demo.
03:13
In this demo, we configured a screened subnet.<br>
