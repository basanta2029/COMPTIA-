1. Router Security
00:04
We're going to talk about using
00:06
a secure router configuration.
00:08
If you're responsible for managing routers, it is
00:10
critical that you use a secure router configuration.
00:13
The way you do this depends on router manufacturer,
00:16
model, configuration interface, and other factors.
00:19
In this lesson, we're going to look at some
00:21
general router security principles that apply
00:23
to a wide variety of router makes and models.
2. Change Default Settings
00:26
The most important aspect of securing any router, regardless
00:29
of manufacturer, is changing default configuration settings.
00:33
By default, routers are configured to use
00:35
a predetermined username and password.
00:38
Typically, this is something like admin and admin,
00:40
or admin and password, or something very similar.
00:43
There's actually even lists out on the
00:44
internet that have the default username and
00:46
password for practically every router model.
00:49
Because of this, it's extremely important you immediately
00:52
change the default username and password on a router.
00:55
In fact, I would recommend you changing this
00:57
configuration before you even connect the
00:59
router to the rest of the network or internet.
01:02
This will ensure that there is zero chance
01:04
someone will compromise the router before you
01:06
have a chance to change this configuration.
01:09
When you're changing the default username, make
01:11
sure to name it something other than admin or
01:13
administrator or root or something easily guess.
01:16
Also make sure you use a very complex password that
01:19
includes numbers, symbols, upper- and lower-case
01:21
letters, and is at minimum 12 characters long.
01:25
Another default setting you might consider
01:26
changing is the default network address.
01:29
Depending on how your organization is configured, you might
01:32
have the ability to select a different IP address range than
01:35
the default 192.168.1 network address that most routers use.
01:40
This approach is known as security through obscurity, which
01:43
by itself isn't actually secure, but if layered with other
01:46
security techniques, it can add just one more obstacle an
01:49
attacker has to get through, albeit a small one.
01:53
Depending on the device or organization you work
01:55
for, you might be using a SOHO all-in-one router
01:58
that includes switching and Wi-Fi capabilities.
02:00
If this is the case, make sure to change the
02:02
default SSID name and wireless encryption settings.
02:05
Another thing you should do when you first set up
02:07
a router is make sure the firmware is up-to-date.
3. Update Firmware
02:10
Oftentimes routers are shipped with older firmware versions.
02:14
Firmware updates contain much needed security fixes
02:17
and vulnerability fixes, so it's important you are
02:19
using the latest firmware version available.
02:22
And always make sure you keep the
02:23
router updated with the latest firmware.
02:26
The next configuration changes you want to make is
02:28
that of the protocol used to connect to the router.
4. Use Secure Protocols
02:32
Some routers use connection protocols that
02:33
send authentication credentials in cleartext.
02:37
This makes it very easy for someone to capture packets
02:39
and identify the login information for the device.
02:43
While most modern routers will use some type
02:46
of secure protocol, such as SSL, it's possible
02:48
you might work with an older router that uses
02:51
an older, unencrypted protocol by default.
02:54
If this is the case, be aware that
02:55
you should use a secure protocol.
02:58
For example, some routers might have FTP
03:00
functionality that allows you to upload configuration
03:03
files or firmware updates to the router.
03:06
Because FTP is an unencrypted transmission protocol,
03:09
the configuration file could be easily captured.
03:12
Instead, you might be able to use SFTP,
03:14
which is the secure, encrypted form of FTP.
03:18
Now, this does all depend on how you are
03:20
connecting to the router to configure it.
03:22
Some routers have a dedicated serial port
03:24
that is used to configure the router.
03:26
This is done instead of a remote configuration
03:28
portal using a web browser or SSH.
03:31
If this is the case, you might not need
03:32
to worry about encrypted transmissions.
03:35
However, if you are working with the router remotely,
03:37
be sure you know which transmission protocol is being
03:40
used and whether or not it is secure.
5. Disable UPnP
03:43
Speaking of using secure protocols, there's
03:44
one protocol that I want to quickly talk about
03:47
that some routers use, especially SOHO routers.
03:50
That protocol is universal plug and play (UPnP).
03:52
UPnP was designed to make setting up media and IoT
03:57
devices, such as smart TVs and gaming consoles, a breeze.
04:01
It works by opening up ports for devices inside
04:03
the network on the fly, eliminating the need to
04:06
manually open up ports for these devices.
04:08
In theory, it's a nice idea.
04:09
However, in practice?
04:11
Not so much.
04:12
UPnP has been plagued with exploit
04:15
after exploit since it was implemented.
04:17
These exploits range from annoying to downright scary.
04:21
Because of this, I highly recommend simply
04:23
disabling UPnP on any router that has it.
04:26
At this time, the convenience isn't worth the risk.
6. Remote Access
04:29
Another area you need to look at with
04:30
routers is that of remote access.
04:33
Most routers will allow you to configure remote access
04:35
optionsâ€”both remote access from within the network and
04:38
remote access from outside the network via the internet.
04:42
It might not be possible to disable
04:43
remote access from inside the network.
04:45
For example, the router might be locked inside of a
04:48
networking closet or server rack case and accessing the
04:51
router would require you to be inside the frigid server room.
04:54
If this is the case, make sure the login
04:56
credentials for remote access are configured
04:58
properly and the protocol used is secure.
05:01
Remote access from outside, on the other
05:03
hand, should 99% of the time be disabled.
05:06
There are really only a handful of times remote
05:07
access from outside the network would be necessary.
05:10
And for these occasions, I recommend only enabling
05:13
for as long as you need it, and not a moment longer.
05:16
Allowing remote access from outside the network opens up
05:18
entire attack surface that you shouldn't have to worry about.
7. Install in a Secure Location
05:22
Like I said earlier, you might not be able
05:24
to have physical access to the router all
05:26
the time, and this is actually a good thing.
05:28
As you already know, it's always a good idea to keep
05:31
networking devices and critical infrastructure components
05:33
under lock and key, and routers are no different.
05:37
With physical access, it's possible for an
05:39
attacker to access a router even if they
05:41
don't have the proper login credentials.
05:43
Because of this, make sure routers
05:45
are stored in a secure location.
05:47
At the very least, keep the router in a locked cabinet.
05:50
But keeping it with other networking equipment
05:52
in a locked cage or lock server room that has the
05:55
appropriate physical security controls is best.
8. Configuration File
05:58
Another important aspect of proper router
06:00
security is that of the configuration file.
06:03
The configuration file stores all the configure
06:06
settings for the router, including open ports,
06:08
usernames, firewall settings, et cetera.
06:11
And often times these files can be backed
06:13
up remotely on a USB drive or workstation.
06:15
If you do backup these files, be sure to
06:17
properly encrypt them so they can't easily read.
06:21
In addition, a lot of routers offer the option to
06:23
encrypt the configuration file on the device itself.
06:27
If your router happens to have this option, enable it.
06:30
This provides an additional layer of security
06:32
should someone gain access to this file.
06:34
And speaking of backing up the configuration
06:36
file, do so on a regular basis.
06:39
And as I said earlier, secure
06:40
you backups by encrypting them.
9. Summary
06:43
Your network is only as strong as its weakest link.
06:45
And if that weak link is the primary entry
06:48
point into your network, as the router is, you
06:50
might have a lot of problems on your hands.
06:52
Keep this in mind when securing your network
06:54
and take the extra time and steps we discussed
06:56
in this lesson to properly secure your router.
