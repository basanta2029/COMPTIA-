1. Network Access Control
00:06
Network Access Control, or NAC, is a process
00:08
control that prevents unauthorized access and
00:10
preserves the integrity of a production network.
00:13
Depending on the configuration, an endpoint must meet
00:16
certain criteria in order to join the internal network.
00:19
In this lesson, we'll discuss the components and steps
00:22
required for an end device to access an internal network.<br>
2. Admission Criteria
00:25
Before an end device can connect, it must go through
00:27
several validation checks, and it meet specified criteria.
00:31
For example, a system may need to be
00:32
running Windows 10 with update 1907.
00:33
It may also need to have the latest antivirus
00:36
latest definitions installed, have Windows
00:39
firewall enabled, have the latest updates
00:41
installed, and have automatic updates enabled.<br>
00:44
If any of this criteria isn't met, the
00:46
system belongs on a restricted network.
00:48
A restricted network has equipment with
00:50
the software, drivers, and updates you
00:52
need to retrieve the required settings.
00:55
Once the system is remediated and receives
00:57
all the updates and system changes, it's
00:59
safe for it to join the production network.<br>
3. NAC Goals
01:02
Depending on the company's business market, a
01:04
compliance model may dictate the level of
01:06
protection and integrity a network system requires.
01:10
Compliance industries include the
01:11
medical, defense, and financial sectors.
01:14
Each one has government-regulated compliance rules.<br>
01:16
The basic tenants of NAC include zero-day attack
01:17
mitigation, role-based controls, traffic encryption,
01:22
identity management, and policy enforcement.
01:25
These goals vary widely depending on NAC implementation,
01:28
configuration, compliance requirements, and industry.
01:31
To create an effective solution, you have to understand the
01:34
resources you're protecting and why you're protecting them.<br>
4. Vendor-Specific Solution
01:38
Now, network access control is a process, not
01:40
a product, although several companies
01:43
implement a product that uses the NAC process.
01:46
For example, Cisco has a solution called
01:48
Identity Services Engine, or ISE, while
01:50
Microsoft has Network Access Protection, or NAP.
01:54
Each is a framework that provides
01:56
protection against unauthorized access or
01:58
rogue system access to a protected network.
02:01
The distinction between products is
02:03
vendor-specific, and so is the implementation.<br>
5. NAC Agent
02:06
Before a device can connect to the production
02:08
network, it must go through a health check.
02:10
The health check is configured by system
02:12
management and may include criteria like antivirus
02:15
software, firewall configurations, and patches.
02:18
This health check is performed by
02:20
software designed solely for this purpose.<br>
02:22
One way to run this software is using an agent.
02:25
An agent is a preinstalled software program that
02:27
performs these health checks at predefined times.
02:30
One example of how this might work happens when the
02:33
workstation attempts a connection to the production network.
02:36
At that time, the agent is activated and goes through
02:39
its checks to ensure that the workstation meets the
02:42
minimum requirements to access the production network.<br>
6. NAC Agentless
02:45
Depending on the vendor, it's also possible
02:47
to perform health checks on demand.
02:50
This process is agentless, meaning it doesn't
02:52
require a permanent agent to be preinstalled.
02:55
Instead, the required software is downloaded and executed at
02:58
the workstation when it attempts to connect to the network.
03:02
Access to the production network is only granted if all
03:05
the prerequisites are met and the health check passes.<br>
7. How NAC Works
03:08
Network Access Control is a policy-driven
03:10
construct that maintains network integrity using
03:13
authentication and authorization policies.
03:15
NAC can be compartmentalized for different types
03:18
of devices such as Internet of Things, Bring Your
03:21
Own Device, or vendors and contractors.<br>
03:23
NAC defines the prerequisites
03:26
and identity, or authentication.
03:28
If a devices meets requirements, NAC
03:31
provides access to the target information.
03:32
You can think of NAC as a layered approach
03:35
to providing network admission and access.
03:38
Let's see how it works.<br>
03:39
The first layer defines the tasks
03:41
required for authentication.
03:43
The authentication layer defines all the prerequisites
03:45
a device must meet to access the network.
03:48
This criteria is detailed in policies that define
03:50
minimum requirements for the device, such as
03:52
anti-malware software, OS type, patch level, and so on.<br>
03:56
Keep in mind that the policies may be
03:58
different for dissimilar types of devices.
04:01
For instance, a tablet may be required to be managed by
04:04
an MDM package or have backup and remote wipe enabled.
04:08
Likewise, an Internet of Things device
04:10
might be required to use a secure VLAN.<br>
04:12
If a device fails authentication, it's
04:14
forwarded to a remediation network.
04:16
This network is protected and doesn't have access to any
04:19
production information or outside areas such as the internet.
04:23
Instead, the remediation network is preconfigured
04:25
to contain all the necessary software and
04:28
procedures to bring a device into compliance.
04:31
It may have software updates, anti-malware
04:32
definitions, and other control software.
04:35
Once a device goes through remediation, it
04:37
goes through the authentication process again.
04:40
If it passes, it moves on to the authorization process.<br>
04:43
The most secure method for ensuring
04:45
integrity is a zero-trust access model.
04:46
This is the concept of least
04:49
privilege, or implicit deny all.
04:52
With this model, users or devices are only given the
04:54
permissions they require to do their jobsâ€“ no more, no less.<br>
04:58
The authorization process looks at the authentication
05:00
information and applies the policies you choose.
05:04
After the device goes through the authorization
05:06
process, it's granted access to the production network.
05:09
This process isn't easy to set up,
05:11
and it's often set up incorrectly.
05:13
Several policies must be put into place,
05:15
and boundary networks must be configured.
05:18
Everything from connectivity devices to routing
05:20
and switching must comply with the necessary
05:23
logic to ensure that this process works.
05:26
While difficult, it may be absolutely necessary in
05:28
higher security environments where integrity is required.
05:32
This is especially true in regulated industries.<br>
8. Next Steps
05:34
NAC is a complicated process that requires forethought.
05:38
The first step is planning.
05:40
A committee should convene and make
05:41
decisions that define how NAC will work.
05:44
Next, roles, identities, and permissions must be defined.
05:48
Then these polices must be applied.
05:50
As business needs change, NAC configuration must be
05:53
reviewed to determine whether it should change, too.<br>
9. Summary
05:56
That's it for this lesson.
05:57
In this video, we discussed how Network
05:59
Access Control is a concept that helps to
06:02
ensure the integrity of a network system.
06:04
It provides a more granular approach to providing network
06:07
access by enforcing minimum requirements applied to devices.<br>
06:11
You can define items such as anti-malware,
06:12
OS versions, patch levels, and more.
06:16
If devices don't meet these requirements,
06:18
they're redirected to a remediation network.
06:20
Once they're authenticated, devices
06:22
are authorized and granted access.
06:24
This is an ongoing process as business
06:26
processes change and the organization grows.<br>
