5.7.2 Device Vulnerability Facts

This lesson covers network device vulnerabilities.
Network Device Vulnerabilities

A knowledgeable attacker can exploit network device vulnerabilities to gain access to network resources. Network device vulnerabilities include:

Vulnerability
Description
Default accounts and passwords	Default accounts and passwords are factory defaults that already exist when a new network device is configured at installation. Default account names and passwords should be changed immediately when hardware or software is turned on for the first time.
Weak passwords	
Weak passwords are passwords that are blank, too short, dictionary words, or simple. In other words, they are passwords that can be quickly identified using password-cracking tools. Password cracking is the process of recovering secret passwords from data stored in or transmitted by a computer system.

Enforce complex passwords to reduce the risks of weak passwords. Complex passwords require passwords of a certain length (typically over eight characters) and a mix of character types (numbers and symbols), along with requirements that the passwords are not words, variations of words, or derivatives of the username.
Privilege escalation	
Privilege escalation allows a user to take advantage of a software bug or design flaw in an application to gain access to system resources or additional privileges that are not typically available to that user. Examples of privilege escalation include:

A user accessing a system with a regular user account that is able to access functions reserved for higher-level user accounts (such as administrative features).
A user who is able to access content that should only be accessible to a different user.
A user who should only have administrative access that can access content that should only be available to a regular user.
Note:
Privilege escalation does not occur when a user is able to steal or hack administrator credentials and is, therefore, able to access administrative functions. Privilege escalation refers to accessing features with an account that normally should not have access to those features.
Backdoors	
A backdoor is an unprotected access method or pathway. Backdoors:

Include hard-coded passwords and hidden service accounts.
Are often added during development as a shortcut to circumvent security. If they are not removed, they present a security problem.
Can be added by attackers who have gained unauthorized access to a device. When added, the backdoor can be used at a future time to bypass security controls easily.
Can be used to control the device remotely at a later date.
Rely on secrecy to maintain security.
To protect against backdoors, do not allow programmers to bypass security during development. Carefully examine the code before release to remove any traces of backdoors that might have been included.
Zero-day	
Zero-day vulnerabilities refer to previously unknown software or hardware flaws that attackers can exploit before developers or vendors become aware of or have a chance to fix them. The term zero-day signifies that developers have "zero days" to fix the problem once the vulnerability becomes known. These vulnerabilities are significant because they can cause widespread damage before a patch is available.

An attacker exploiting a zero-day vulnerability can compromise systems, steal sensitive data, launch further attacks, or cause other forms of harm, often undetected. The stealth and unpredictability of zero-day attacks make them particularly dangerous. They are a favored tool of advanced threat actors, such as organized crime groups and nation-state attackers, who often use them in targeted attacks against high-value targets, such as governmental institutions and major corporations.

Since these vulnerabilities are unknown to the public or the vendor during exploitation, traditional security measures like antivirus software and firewalls, which rely on known signatures or attack patterns, are often ineffective against them. The discovery of a zero-day vulnerability typically triggers a race between threat actors, who aim to exploit it, and developers, who work to patch it. Upon discovering a zero-day vulnerability, ethical security researchers usually follow a process known as responsible disclosure, designed to privately inform the vendor so a patch can be developed before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed. This practice aims to limit the potential harm caused by discovering a zero-day vulnerability.

The term zero-day is usually applied to the vulnerability itself but can also refer to an attack or malware that exploits it. Zero-day vulnerabilities have significant financial value. A zero-day exploit for a mobile OS can be worth millions of dollars. Consequently, an adversary will only use a zero-day vulnerability for high-value attacks. State security and law enforcement agencies are known to stockpile zero-days to facilitate the investigation of crimes.
