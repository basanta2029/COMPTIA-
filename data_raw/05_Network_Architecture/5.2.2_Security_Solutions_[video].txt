1. Security Solutions
00:03
Many of us take for granted the clean
00:05
water we get from our faucets every day.
00:07
Before we take a drink, the dangerous contaminants have
00:09
been filtered out, leaving us with only what we want.
00:12
One very important security solution for networks
00:15
is filtering: content filtering and web filtering.
00:18
Just like filtering out dangerous contaminants from our
00:20
drinking water, content filters and web filters filter
00:24
out dangerous contaminants to our networks and users.
00:26
Let's take a closer look.<br>
2. Content Filtering Server
00:28
Let's start with content filtering servers.
00:31
Content filtering servers typically
00:33
have one or two configurations.
00:35
Either you allow all content except for
00:37
what you decide to ban, or you block all
00:39
content except for what you decide to allow.
00:42
These controls are implemented through security
00:44
levels, allow lists, deny lists, and category levels.<br>
00:48
A content filter is designed to give network
00:50
administrators and management the ability to
00:52
block unwanted or inappropriate website browsing.
00:56
For example, several organizations have
00:58
guidelines stating that users can't visit adult
01:00
sites, gambling, or shopping sites while at work.
01:03
A content filter can be put in place, and the
01:05
network administrator can configure the filter to
01:07
prevent users from visiting these types of sites.<br>
01:10
Most often, the content filter allows everything except
01:13
sites and categories that are blocked via a denylist.
01:16
For additional flexibility, security groups can be
01:18
configured to allow or prevent site access by group.<br>
01:22
New websites are created every day, so the filters
01:24
must be updated regularly, like virus definitions.
01:27
Most content filtering servers have an online
01:30
subscription service to update websites and website
01:32
categories at certain intervals, usually daily or weekly.<br>
3. Web Filtering
01:36
Now, web filtering plays a pivotal role
01:39
in safeguarding an organization's network.
01:41
Its primary function is to block users from accessing
01:44
malicious or inappropriate websites, thereby
01:46
protecting the network from potential threats.<br>
01:49
Web filters analyze web traffic, often in real-time, and
01:53
can restrict access based on various criteria such as URL,
01:57
IP address, content category, or even specific keywords.<br>
02:01
Now, let's look at two different approaches
02:02
to web filtering: agent-based and centralized.
02:06
The first approach is focused on filtering at each endpoint.
02:09
The second filters from a centralized proxy
02:11
server that endpoints are connected to.<br>
4. Agent-based Filtering
02:13
Agent-based web filtering involves installing a software
02:17
agent on desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices.
02:21
The agents enforce compliance with the
02:22
organization's web filtering policies.
02:25
Agents communicate with a centralized management
02:27
server to retrieve filtering policies and rules
02:30
and then apply them locally on the device.
02:33
Agent-based solutions typically leverage cloud
02:35
platforms to ensure they can communicate with devices
02:37
regardless of the network they're connected to.
02:40
This means filtering policies remain in effect
02:42
even when users are off the corporate network,
02:44
such as when working from home or traveling.<br>
02:47
Because filtering occurs locally on the device,
02:50
agent-based methods often provide more granular
02:52
control, such as filtering HTTPS traffic or applying
02:56
different filtering rules for different applications.
02:59
Agent-based filtering can also provide
03:01
detailed reporting and analytics.<br>
5. Centralized Web Filtering
03:04
In a centralized approach, a proxy server performs
03:06
content filtering by analyzing web requests from
03:09
users and determining whether to permit or deny
03:11
access based on established policies.
03:14
A centralized proxy server acts as an
03:16
intermediary between end users and the internet.
03:19
Beyond blocking unwanted or harmful content, a
03:22
centralized proxy server can also perform
03:24
detailed logging and reporting of web activity.<br>
03:28
A centralized proxy server employs various
03:30
techniques to protect web traffic and ensure
03:32
the safety of an organization's network.
03:35
A proxy server can perform URL scanning, which
03:37
involves blocking URLs known to host malicious content,
03:41
are inappropriate, or violate the company's policies.<br>
03:44
Proxy servers also allow content categorization.
03:47
This means that websites can be classified
03:49
into various categories like social networking,
03:52
gambling, webmail, and many others.
03:55
Organizations can define rules to allow
03:57
or deny access based on these categories.<br>
04:00
Another technique proxy servers
04:02
can implement is block rules.
04:04
For example, an organization could block all .exe
04:07
downloads or certain domains or content categories.<br>
04:11
Proxy servers can even incorporate reputation-based
04:13
filtering, which leverages continually updated databases that
04:17
score websites based on their observed behavior and history.
04:21
Sites known for hosting malware, engaging in phishing
04:23
attacks, or distributing spam, for instance, would have a
04:26
poor reputation score and could be automatically blocked.<br>
6. Web Filtering Challenges
04:30
Content and web filtering aren't
04:31
without potential issues and challenges.
04:33
One common problem is overblocking or underblocking.
04:35
Overblocking occurs when the filter is too restrictive,
04:40
inadvertently blocking access to legitimate and useful
04:43
websites and negatively impacting employee productivity.<br>
04:46
Underblocking, on the other hand, occurs
04:48
when the filter allows access to potentially
04:51
harmful or inappropriate websites.<br>
04:53
Another issue is the handling
04:55
of encrypted traffic like HTTPS.
04:57
Without proper configuration, web filters
05:00
may be unable to inspect encrypted traffic,
05:02
representing most modern web traffic.<br>
7. Summary
05:05
Well, that's it for this lesson.
05:06
In this lesson, we discussed security
05:08
solutions based on content and web filtering.
05:11
We looked at how content filters can either allow
05:13
everything except what you specifically ban or they
05:16
can ban everything except what's specifically allowed.
05:19
We then looked at two approaches to web filtering:
05:22
agent-based, which is applied to endpoints, and
05:24
centralized, which is provided through a proxy
05:26
server that network traffic flows through.
05:29
We ended the lesson by looking at the challenge of
05:31
not overblocking or underblocking when applying
05:34
filters so that the network is protected, and users
05:36
can do their work and access their resources.<br>
