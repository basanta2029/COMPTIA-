1. Network Application Security
00:04
In this lesson, we'll talk about how applications can pose
00:07
a threat to your network and how to manage those risks.
00:10
We start by looking for vulnerabilities.<br>
2. Vulnerability Scanning
00:12
Vulnerability scanning is a crucial aspect
00:15
of cybersecurity that aids in identifying
00:17
weaknesses in a system's security defenses.<br>
00:20
Imagine your organization's network and
00:22
software systems as a secure facility and
00:25
vulnerability scanning as a diligent guard<br>
00:27
searching for weak points in its fence.<br>
00:30
To achieve this, cybersecurity professionals
00:31
use specialized tools like openVAS and Nessus.
00:35
These tools act as vigilant security guards,
00:38
examining various aspects of your network and systems.
00:41
They check for issues such as outdated software,
00:44
misconfigured settings, and missing patches, which can
00:47
serve as potential entry points for malicious actors.<br>
00:51
However, when it comes to application
00:52
security, a more tailored approach is needed.
00:55
Applications are like unique rooms within your
00:57
secure facility, each with its own vulnerabilities.
01:01
Traditional vulnerability scanning tools
01:03
can't fully grasp these intricacies.
01:06
For this, we turn to specialized application scanners,
01:09
penetration testing frameworks, and code testing methods.<br>
3. Application Vulnerability Scanning
01:13
Application vulnerability scanning is a
01:15
refined process that zeros in on the specific
01:18
weaknesses within software applications.
01:21
Think of it as having an expert locksmith who
01:23
knows the ins and outs of each room's lock and key.<br>
01:27
This scanning method employs two techniques:
01:29
static analysis and dynamic analysis.
01:33
Static analysis involves reviewing the
01:35
application's code without executing it, much
01:38
like scrutinizing the blueprints of a room.
01:40
Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, tests the running
01:43
applications, uncovering issues like unvalidated inputs,
01:47
broken access controls, and SQL injection vulnerabilities
01:50
by actively trying to breach the application's defenses.<br>
01:54
These vulnerabilities are unique to
01:56
software applications, and their discovery
01:58
requires specialized tools and techniques.
02:01
Managing these risks necessitates a separate
02:04
approach from general vulnerability scanning<br>
02:06
because applications often follow their own update
02:09
cycles and have distinct security challenges.<br>
4. Package Monitoring
02:12
In the complex world of software development,
02:14
applications often rely on external
02:17
components, like libraries and dependencies.
02:20
Imagine these components as pieces of
02:22
machinery inside your secure facility.<br>
02:25
Package monitoring is the process of
02:26
keeping a watchful eye on these components.
02:29
It ensures they're up-to-date and free from
02:31
known vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.
02:34
This is essential because just<br>
02:36
like a compromised piece of machinery can weaken the
02:39
security of your facility, outdated or vulnerable software
02:42
components can jeopardize your application's security.<br>
02:46
To achieve this, organizations use automated
02:48
tools like Software Composition Analysis tools.
02:51
These tools constantly compare your software
02:53
inventory against databases of known vulnerabilities,
02:57
ensuring that your components are sturdy and reliable.
03:00
They can also suggest updates or replacements
03:03
when vulnerabilities are discovered.<br>
03:05
In addition to automated tools, organizations
03:08
establish governance policies around software usage.
03:11
These policies mandate regular audits of software
03:13
packages, require approvals for new additions, and
03:17
outline procedures for updating or patching
03:19
software in case vulnerabilities are identified.<br>
5. Summary
03:22
So, think of vulnerability scanning, application
03:25
vulnerability scanning, and package monitoring as the
03:28
various layers of security in your facility: one guarding
03:31
the perimeter, another securing the rooms, and the last
03:34
ensuring the reliability of the machinery within.
03:37
Together, they form a comprehensive
03:39
defense against modern cyber threats.<br>
