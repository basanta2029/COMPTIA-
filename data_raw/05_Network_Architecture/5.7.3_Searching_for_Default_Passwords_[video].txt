1. Searching for Default Passwords
00:04
In this demonstration, we'll look at
00:06
some default network device passwords.
00:08
When you install a new network device, it's almost
00:11
always going to have some sort of default
00:14
administrative account with an associated password.
00:17
You can find these by doing a search for default
00:20
network device passwords, like I did up here.
2. New Laws
00:24
Some states and countries require
00:25
unique passwords for each device.
00:28
Here's the website for the State of California Legislature.
00:31
If I scroll down, you can see where I
00:34
highlighted this line, "The preprogrammed
00:37
password is unique to each device manufactured."
00:40
That means in order to sell devices in this state,
00:44
I have to make sure each one has a unique password.
00:47
Since these sort of laws have been implemented,
00:49
most manufactures are doing this for devices
00:52
sold anywhere, which is a good practice.
00:55
But not all devices come with unique
00:57
passwords, especially enterprise equipment.
3. Find Default Passwords on the Web
01:00
On legacy equipment, having default passwords
01:03
presents a security issue because these usernames and
01:06
passwords are very well known and very easy to find.
01:10
If someone learns your device's make and model
01:12
and you haven't changed the default password,
01:14
they could cause some serious damage.
01:17
Let's say we have a Netgear router, and we
01:19
want to find out what the default password is.
01:22
Well, I did a search, like we already saw,
01:25
and here are some of the sites I found.
01:27
This first one, CIRT.net, is a pretty good site.
01:31
It has over 2,100 default passwords on it.
01:35
And if we come down here, we can find Netgear, and
01:38
you can see a variety of different makes and models.
01:42
It looks like for admin, password is
01:45
a common default password for Netgear.
01:47
Let's check out another one, datarecovery.com.
01:48
I'll press Ctrl+F to do a search and type in â€˜netgear'.
01:55
I'll move down, and we can see a list of Netgear devices.
01:59
Once again, you can see the usernames and passwords.
02:02
This one's credentials are admin and password.
02:06
Let's look at one more site.
02:07
This one is routerpasswords.com.
02:11
I can come down and look for our Netgear devices again.
02:14
I'll click on Find Passwords and see the variety of
02:17
different Netgear network devices they've listed.
02:19
On this site, it looks like most of the
02:22
default usernames and passwords are admin and
02:24
password, although there is some variance.
02:28
We can also see how you interface with the device, whether
02:31
it's over a web browser using HTTP, FTP, or some other way.
4. Summary
02:36
That's it for this demo.
02:38
We searched the web for some default
02:40
usernames and passwords for network devices.
02:43
Remember, always change the default username
02:45
and password on new network devices.
02:48
Leaving default credentials presents a huge security risk.
