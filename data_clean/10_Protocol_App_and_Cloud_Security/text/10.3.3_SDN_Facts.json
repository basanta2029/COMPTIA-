The idea is that network engineers are able to use software to configure and intelligently control the network rather than relying on the individual static configuration files located on each network device. SDN uses a controller to manage the devices. The controller is software that is able to inventory hardware components in the network, gather network statistics, make routing decisions based on gathered data, and facilitate communication between devices from different vendors. It can also be used to make widespread configuration changes on just one device. The SDN architecture consists of three layers. The table below shows the functions: SDN Layer Function Application layer\tThe Application layer communicates with the Control layer through what is called the northbound interface. These are sometimes called northbound APIs. Control layer\tThe Control layer receives its requests from the Application layer and then provides the Physical layer with its configuration and instructions. Physical layer The Physical layer, also known as the Infrastructure layer, communicates to the Control layer through the southbound interface. The individual networking devices use southbound APIs to communicate with the control plane and vice versa. Even though this layer is called the Physical layer, it is where both physical and virtual network devices sit. This architecture allows for fully automated deployment (or provisioning) of network links, appliances, and servers. This makes SDN an important part of the latest automation and orchestration technologies.

      "summary": "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a modern approach that enables network and security professionals to manage networks through software rather than static configurations on individual devices. It operates on a three-layer architecture—Application, Control, and Physical—allowing for automated deployment and efficient management of network resources. While SDN offers significant advantages such as flexibility and centralized control, it also presents challenges, including potential security vulnerabilities and reliance on the controller's functionality.",
