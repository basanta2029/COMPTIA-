There are two types of virtual devices that we can easily manage from here. One of them would be virtual switches, and I'm using the server version of Hyper-V, which is running on a Windows Server 2022. It's essentially the same as the client version, but all virtualization programs are going to have some type of virtual switch management. In Hyper-V, we're going to access the Virtual Switch Manager. The virtual switch should be created before you create your virtual machines. Now, in Hyper-V, we have different types of virtual switches. For example, I can create a private switch, and I'll just click 'Create Virtual Switch.' The private switch allows the virtual machines to communicate with each other, and that's it. If I wanted to establish an internal network, they could communicate with other virtual machines, interact among themselves and with the host, but they can't access the external network. Alternatively, I could set up an external network where they can actually use the host's network card directly. You can see there's a check mark here for 'Allow management operating system to share this network adapter.' This means I'm using the same network adapter for both the virtual machines and the host. In a real server environment, it would be best practice to install a couple of network cards, allowing the host to use one network card and the virtual machines to use the other network card. I can also enable VLANs on my virtual switches if I'm using VLANs. I've created a couple of private switches here, 'private' and 'private 2.' I also have an external switch called 'Internet.' I have plenty to work with. After setting up your virtual switches, the next step is to connect the virtual network cards within the virtual machines to the virtual switch. We're going to examine the settings in this test VM that I have here to see what happens. I already have a synthetic network adapter installed in this machine, and it's connected to the private network. Again, if I'm using VLANs, I can enable VLAN identification. Depending on your virtualization system, you may have other additional features. For instance, I can enable bandwidth management to prevent this virtual machine from monopolizing the network card's bandwidth. There are also additional features available when expanding the network card settings. For example, I can configure IPsec offloading, allowing the network card to handle some of the IPsec work when encryption using IPsec is in use. I can specify the details of how it should be handled. Furthermore, there are advanced features where I can customize the MAC address or enable MAC spoofing, which is required for supporting network load balancing. I also have DHCP guard to prevent this virtual machine from acting as a rogue DHCP server and router guard to stop it from becoming a rogue router. Additionally, I can designate it as a protected network, meaning that if its network is disconnected and this machine is part of a high availability solution, it would fail over to the other node in that cluster. Port mirroring allows me to send a copy of network traffic to another machine, which can be useful for monitoring purposes. For instance, if I'm using a product like Network Monitor or Wireshark. I can also implement NIC Teaming, allowing me to use multiple adapters in the guest operating system and link them together for either increased bandwidth or fault tolerance. In this demonstration, we examined the various options for managing virtual devices.",
