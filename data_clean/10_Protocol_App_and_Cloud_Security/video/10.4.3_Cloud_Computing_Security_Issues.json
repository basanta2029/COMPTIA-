The benefits offered by cloud computing—\"the ability to use applications, platforms, and infrastructure as needed, and not use them when you don't—\"is attractive. However, security is a key issue. In a traditional system, you secure data behind layer after layer of security mechanisms—\"firewalls, ACLs, encryption, et cetera. And even after all that, it's still a challenge to keep your network safe. Add in the cloud component, and now all that data is being sent across the internet to a third-party organization who also needs to maintain their own system security. Ultimately, the decision to utilize a cloud provider comes down to a partnership of trust. The cloud computing service provider has to ensure the security and privacy of your information. Security is part of the service they provide. However, you, as a security administrator, are still responsible for protecting your company's data. One of the key things you need to remember is that industry and government regulations created to protect personal and business information still apply. Even though the data is being stored by the cloud computing provider, you're still responsible. Whenever an organization is evaluating a move to the cloud, I always tell them that they need to approach the process of picking a cloud service provider in the same way they would buying a used car from a dealership. A used car may look great on the surface, but what you really need to be concerned with is what's under the hood. Take the same approach when selecting a cloud service provider. Let's go over some of the key security considerations you need to keep in mind if you use a cloud service provider. First, there's an issue of trust. You have to trust that your cloud service provider is good at information security. If your provider hasn't done a good job securing their environment, you could be in trouble. You can insist that the cloud services provider implement specific security measures, but you can't physically make them. In addition, there's a monitoring issue. It's difficult to monitor security issues when your environment is provided by a cloud service provider. You're not on site, so you don't know what security issues they're facing. You don't see the midnight attack that they had to fight off last night. The cloud service provider probably doesn't want to let you know about it because they're afraid you might terminate their services. Likewise, it's difficult to measure a cloud provider's degree of competence with information security because they probably don't want to expose their infrastructure to customers. Therefore, as we talked about with monitoring, it's hard to know how things are really going with your cloud computing environment. All you see really is the user interface. Another thing to consider is authentication. Make sure that the cloud service provider authenticates everyone who's going to use the service. Don't choose the cloud service provider if they allow free access. The next key thing to look for is partitioning. In other words, they make sure that your information and your data is kept completely separate from other customers' information and data. You don't want a fellow cloud computing customer gaining access to your data. Within your organization, make sure that your individual users only have access to the applications that they need. Do not allow them to choose whatever they want to use. One way to do this is to use a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB). A CASB is a software tool or a service that sits between an organization and a cloud service provider. Its job is to make sure that all communication and access to the cloud service provider complies with the organization's security policies and procedures. For example, it might make sure devices connecting to the cloud meet certain security standards, such as full-device encryption, up-to-date malware protection, et cetera. The next key thing to look for is updating. Make sure that the cloud service provider maintains a rigorous patch management program to ensure that the systems are updated. This will help protect your information from potential exploits. After that, check out their processes. A good cloud computing service provider should have processes, policies, and procedures in place to handle various events. These processes, policies, and procedures should include everything, from something as simple as requesting access to a new application or something as critical as dealing with a major security breach. When you're evaluating a company, ask the company for a copy of these policies and procedures so you can see what they are going to do if a certain event happens. In addition, verify that the cloud service provider has policies and procedures in place for monitoring security logs, monitoring unusual behavior, and performing the various tasks required to keep their system safe. Next, make sure that they use some form of encryption to ensure that the data passing between your organization and their service is encrypted and can't be sniffed. Most likely, the data will pass through the untrusted network connection that is the internet. Secure data transmission is critical. Last, the cloud computing service provider should probe their system on a regular basis. They should contract with a third party whose expertise is breaking into systems. The third party should probe the cloud computing service to see if there are any weaknesses that can be exploited. Cloud services are here to stay. No matter the organization you work for, they are probably going to use some type of cloud service. This is because cloud services are very cost-effective and convenient. However, with convenience comes risk. And it's your job as a security professional to identify those risk, account for them, and minimize them as much as possible.",
