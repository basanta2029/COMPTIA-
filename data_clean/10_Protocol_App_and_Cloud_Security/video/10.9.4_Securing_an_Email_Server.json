To do this, we've installed an SMTP email service on this Windows Server 2022 system. Let's go to Tools. We're going to go to the IIS 6.0 Manager. Expand that. We managed this service using the IIS Manager 6.0. Most email servers currently available will have similar SMTP capabilities and provide the same SMTP options. Firstly, we can right-click on our SMTP server. Go to Properties. From here, we can lock down this email server. We're going to go to the Access tab. On the Access tab, you can require authentication to access this server. The default is Anonymous access, meaning anybody can connect without authenticating. You should disable this option and require at least Basic authentication. If you have Anonymous authentication enabled and allow open relay, spammers will quickly find this system and start bouncing spam off your server to cover their tracks. If this happens, you're the one who gets in trouble, and your ISP may block your email server. You can also use Integrated Windows Authentication, which would require you to use the domain credentials to authenticate. Basic authentication requires users just to enter a password but be aware that basic authentication is sent clear text by default, which would expose the password. Alternatively, you can combine it with TLS encryption, the next generation of SSL, to secure authentication credentials as they're transmitted on the network. You can also require a secure connection to connect to this SMTP server in the first place. This option requires an SSL or TLS certificate for this server to secure the connection. You can also use Connection control to configure who's allowed to connect to this SMTP server and who is blocked from connecting. This can be done using your IP addresses. You can use a range of IPs. You can also do this using domain names as well. This requires reverse DNS lookups to be enabled. Using this information, you can restrict who is allowed access to the server. You can also implement Relay restrictions, which specify who is allowed to relay email through the SMTP server. You can allow everyone except those specified on the list or block everyone except those on the list. As before, you can also specify an IP or IP range or a domain name. That's it for this demonstration. In this demonstration, we reviewed a few security configurations you can implement to prevent email from being relayed off of your SMTP server.",

      "summary": "This section focuses on securing an email server by preventing spam relaying through proper configuration of the SMTP service on Windows Server 2022. Key practices include disabling anonymous access and requiring authentication, such as Basic or Integrated Windows Authentication, to protect against unauthorized use and potential spam attacks. Emphasizing the importance of these settings helps ensure the integrity of the email server and compliance with ISP regulations.",

      "summary": "The Securing Authentication section emphasizes the importance of using TLS encryption to protect authentication credentials during transmission over networks, particularly when connecting to SMTP servers. It covers the implementation of secure connections through SSL/TLS certificates, as well as connection control measures that restrict access based on IP addresses or domain names. Additionally, it discusses relay restrictions to manage who can send emails through the SMTP server, enhancing overall security.",
