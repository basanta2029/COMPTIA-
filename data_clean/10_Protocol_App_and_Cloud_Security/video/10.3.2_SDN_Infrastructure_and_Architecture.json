We'll go over how software-defined networking can enhance your infrastructure to be more responsive, scalable, and secure. In a previous lesson, we looked at how the SDN controller can respond to changing network conditions and make changes to data flow. Let's take a look at the underlying SDN architecture to see how this is done. So, we have our controller right here. Remember, the controller itself is just a software platform that contains other applications it's the network's operating system. The SDN architecture consists of three layers. In the middle, there's the control layer. This is where the controller resides. Above that is the application layer. This is where various applications reside. One of these could be an app that creates a network map of all the devices in your network. Another one could be a load balancer that stops and starts VMs as resource use increases. The application layer and these various apps communicate with the control layer through what's called the northbound interface. These are sometimes called northbound APIs. Below the control layer is the physical layer. This is where the physical networking devices reside. Even though it's called the physical layer, it's also where the virtual networking devices reside. The physical layer communicates to the control layer through the southbound interface. The individual networking devices use southbound APIs to communicate with the control plane, and vice versa. Understand that this control layer, the control plane, removes that control plane from the physical networking devices. In traditional networks, each of these devices would have an integrated control plane located on the device. However, SDN removes this from the devices and creates a single control plane. There's one last thing to be aware of regarding software-defined networks. As with the implementation of any new feature or technology, the transition comes with some inherent challenges. For example, a centralized controller introduces a new target for attackers. Imagine a third-party application that uses the northbound API to gain complete knowledge of your entire network. That could be very dangerous. Therefore, it's important to be aware of proper security techniques and how these interfaces can be compromised. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we took a deeper look into software-defined networking, or networking programmability. We also talked about some of the security concerns you need to be aware of with SDN.",

      "summary": "This section on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) explores its role in enhancing network infrastructure by making it more responsive, scalable, and secure. It emphasizes the functionality of the SDN controller in adapting to dynamic network conditions and optimizing data flow. Practical applications include improved network management and security measures that can be implemented through SDN architecture.",

      "summary": "The SDN (Software-Defined Networking) architecture comprises three layers: the application layer, control layer, and physical layer. The control layer houses the controller, which acts as the network's operating system, facilitating communication between applications in the application layer and physical or virtual networking devices in the physical layer through northbound and southbound interfaces, respectively. This separation of the control plane from individual devices enhances network management and flexibility compared to traditional networking models.",
