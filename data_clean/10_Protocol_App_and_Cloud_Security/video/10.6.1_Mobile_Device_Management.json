So managing mobile devices is a major focus for most organizations. Most employees bring a personal mobile device to work, usually a cell phone, tablet, or laptop. When these personal electronics are used for business activity, they're called BYOD devices, which stands for bring your own device. Before mobile devices were common, every device that connected to a network was stationary, such as a desktop or printer, so you could add it to a domain and manage it with Group Policy settings. But it's not that simple anymore. Organizations need to manage mobile devices and enforce policies to secure their data. If an employee copies sensitive data to a device, the organization needs to be sure that the data will be kept safe outside the organizational network. This is where Mobile Device Management policies come in. We're going to cover the four main types of mobile device management: Mobile Device Management, Mobile Application Management, Enterprise Mobility Management, and Unified Endpoint Management. Let's start with Mobile Device Management, or MDM. MDM allows IT administrators to remotely manage a mobile device, even if it's a personally owned device used for work. MDM lets you track the device, push apps and updates, manage security, and even remotely wipe the device. This solution works well for company-owned devices, but the release of the iPhone in 2007 caused a huge increase in the number personal devices brought to work and used for work-related purposes, such as email. Employees didn't want their employers to have too much control over their personal devices. This is when Mobile Application Management solutions were created. Mobile Application Management, or MAM, solutions focus on managing the applications on a mobile device, not the device itself. Applications that the organization has developed or any application that the organization provides licenses for falls under MAM policies. The organization can put limitations on these apps, such as disabling copy and paste functions. IT administration can uninstall the app and the data related to it in case the device is lost or stolen. As more devices were release and their use spread, MDM and MAM solutions evolved to keep up with changing demands and eventually merged into a solution called Enterprise Mobility Management. One of the main drawbacks of MDM and MAM solutions is that there are so many different types of devices and operating systems. Each device type requires separate management tools and systems. Enterprise Mobility Management, or EMM, solutions solve this problem. EMM is a combination of MDM and MAM methods into one package solution. EMM is hardware-agnostic and can remotely manage a mobile device's hardware and applications. One of the more popular solutions for Enterprise Mobility Management is Microsoft's Intune. Intune is a part of the Microsoft Enterprise Mobility and Security Suite that's accessed through an organization's Azure portal. Intune allows IT administrators to manage mobile devices and apps, control access to data, and ensure that devices comply with security policies. Microsoft Intune is included with any Enterprise agreement of at least 500 users, and it supports all mobile device types. I probably don't have to tell you that integrating device security with Azure's Active Directory make managing mobile devices much, much simpler. Of course, IT administrators need to worry about managing everything else that's on their network, too: desktop computers, printers, Internet of Things devices, and wearables. This need was met by the creation of another solution called Unified Endpoint Management, or UEM. UEM tools provide a single point of management for all network devices. Essentially, they are a marriage of traditional device management and Enterprise Mobile Device Management solutions. All right, that's all for this video. In this lesson, we looked at mobile device management solutions, including Mobile Device Management, Mobile Application Management, Enterprise Mobility Management, and Unified Endpoint Management. We also talked about Microsoft's EMM solution, Intune.",
