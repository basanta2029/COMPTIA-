One powerful benefit and feature is load balancing. Let's look at how load balancing works with virtual machines, or VMs. VMs run on top of a hypervisor which is installed on physical hardware called a host. The hypervisor decouples the hardware from the VMs, or workloads. If we have two or more hosts, we can create a cluster. Clusters usually require shared storage like a SAN where the actual VM files reside and can be managed as a single entity. While workloads are running in memory, they still use real resources – real physical memory, real storage, and really CPUs, and the cluster manages that linking in an effective, optimized way. For example, if the cluster contains eight host servers with four quad-core CPUs each running at 4GHz and 64GB of memory, the cluster has an aggregate of 512GHz of CPU power and 512GB of memory available for running VMs. Having a cluster provides a number of benefits, including high-availability, load balancing, and high performance. Let's look at load balancing. A cluster can sense which hosts are busy and offload workloads to a less busy host. It does this by monitoring hardware resources like CPU and RAM on each host of the cluster to determine the best placement for all the workloads. The load is evaluated frequently, and workloads can be adjusted dynamically to reallocate when needed. This means a VM or workload could move from one host to another in a cluster for better performance. And what's cool is this is seamless to the user—they don't even notice all this is happening on the back end. This dynamic allocation load balances the workloads across hosts in the cluster based on host resource load and availability. When a host gets busy, workloads will be moved to another host on the fly. That's powerful, and ensures each workload gets the very best performance possible. Not all your hosts will have the same hardware with CPU and RAM resources. Some hosts will be beefier than others. Some will have newer processors. This means that some hosts can handle more dense workloads than others. The cluster can sense how busy each host is and adjust, or load-balance, the workloads for best performance and to best utilize CPU and memory resources across the cluster. Within a cluster, we can usually create what's called a resource pool. This helps us allocate CPU and RAM resources to prioritize our workloads. Some workloads may have applications that are mission critical and require specific resources to always be up and running properly. Other workloads may not be as important, but still need adequate resources. Resource pooling allows us to establish performance boundaries within the cluster, so resources aren't consumed by low-level workloads and keep important workloads from starving for resources. So, a resource pool works within the cluster, and may span two or more host servers. Let's create Resource Pool A with a certain amount of RAM and CPU shares. After creating the pool, we can then assign or create VMs to run in the pool. We can create as many pools as we like in our cluster, but we must always assign them CPU and memory performance. Here's another pool – Resource Pool B. We'll assign it a certain amount of CPU and RAM, and then we'll assign VMs to it. In essence, the workloads end up being load balanced, and they are throttled to only use the established resource limits. This allows admins to aggregate computing capacity and delegate it for use rather than focus on individual host servers. And, as a bonus, if one host server goes down, the other servers in the cluster will pick up the workloads and continue on. You can create a resource pool on an individual host. However, if you have a cluster, resource pooling will provide more resources across the hosts in a cluster, allowing you to better manage the use of those hardware resources, including reservations for CPU and RAM usage. The VMs will be load balanced within the resource pool within the cluster. This provides for rapid elasticity which leverages virtualized server and storage technologies to rapidly meet the rise and fall of user load and service demand. Hypervisor software that supports resource pooling is downloadable from the internet. You can download an evaluation copy to set up and experiment with load balancing on virtual machines. That's it for this lesson. Within the context of virtualization, that's how load balancing works. Clustering allows VMs to be load balanced and highly available while providing the best performance possible for each workload. And resource pooling allows us to aggregate hardware resources across multiple hosts ensuring that the workloads get the resources they need without sacrificing the performance of others.",
