Virtual devices save organizations money. By using less physical storage space, a company is able to have at least twice as many devices in a network because they pay for very little space in a data center. One form of network virtualization is protocol-based. You should already be familiar with this type of virtualization. VLANs and VPNs are two examples of protocol-based network virtualization. Remember, with a VLAN, the network devices aren't physically segmented. The only thing that segments these devices is software defining how communications are routed by looking at the VLAN IDs of packets. The same is true with a VPN. There's no dedicated, physical connection between two devices using a VPN. It's a virtualized dedicated connection. Now, let's go over some virtual networking devices and how they can be used to create a more secure network design. The first network device we'll look at is a virtual switch, or vSwitch. A vSwitch is a software application that facilitates the communication between VMs by checking data packets before moving them to a destination. vSwitches are often integrated with virtual machine software. Sometimes, they're even part of a server's firmware. The nice thing about a vSwitch is it's much easier to implement and manage than a traditional switch. In addition, a vSwitch can actually ensure the security integrity of virtual hosts, thereby creating a more secure network. For example, a vSwitch could make sure that a VM meets certain security criteria before it is allowed to communicate on the virtual network. If it fails the security check, its communications will be blocked. Some of the most common vSwitch platforms are Open vSwitch (OVS), VMware virtual switch, and the Cisco Nexus 1000v. All three can function within a software-defined network as an SDN controller, allowing a much more dynamic network environment. A virtual router, or vRouter, is a software function that replicates a physical router. The nice thing about a virtual router is that it doesn't need to rely on the IP routing functionality used by physical routers. This means you can move routing functions around a network freely, creating a more dynamic network environment. In addition, when you use a virtual router, you are free from a specific vendor ecosystem. This means you aren't locked in to proprietary applications or protocols and can more customize your networking environment. Virtual routers even work well with SDN infrastructure. Note that, while virtual networking devices can be very flexible and offer a lot of benefits, they still aren't a replacement for physical networking devices. Virtual networking devices use shared hardware resources, making them a poor choice for resource-intensive tasks, such as encrypting and decrypting information. Load balancing can also become an issue as the resources used to route, switch, and load-balance communication are shared among the devices. Another drawback is all of these components rely on software applications and are susceptible to things like VM escape. If your entire network is virtualized, there is no physical boundary between certain systems. With physically segmented systems, it is impossible for an attacker to leap between segments without physical access. With virtual segmentation, an attacker only needs to know of an exploit that allows the leap. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at virtual networking devices. We looked at protocol-based virtualization, virtual switches, and virtual routers. We looked at how these virtual devices can benefit a networking environment. And we finished by looking at some of the drawbacks of virtual networking devices.",

By using less physical storage space, a company is able to have at least twice as many devices in a network because they pay for very little space in a data center.",
      "summary": "Virtual networks consist of both virtual and physical devices, allowing organizations to optimize resources and reduce costs. By minimizing physical storage requirements, companies can effectively double the number of devices within their networks, leading to increased efficiency and scalability in data center operations. This approach highlights the importance of virtualization in modern cybersecurity strategies.",
