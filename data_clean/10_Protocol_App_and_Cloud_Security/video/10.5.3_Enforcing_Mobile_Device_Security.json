These issues include making sure that the apps haven't been tampered with, that they don't contain malware, and that they're not sending information to other parties without approval. The first issue we're going to look at is application control. Let's start by looking at iOS devices. All apps on iOS devices come from Apple's app store. The Apple app store uses several different mechanisms to secure those apps. One mechanism is sandboxing. A sandboxed app cannot access data stored by other apps running on the device. They cannot access system files or system resources. In addition, all iOS apps are digitally signed by Apple or a third-party developer. The digital signature uses an Apple-issued certificate and ensures that the apps from the app store haven't been tampered with. App developers can use encryption APIs to protect their app's data. Developers can use symmetric encryption, generated using AES, RC4, or Triple DES. For Windows mobile devices, all apps come from the Windows store. Like iOS apps, Windows Store apps are digitally signed by Microsoft before they can be loaded on Windows mobile devices. Again, this ensures that the apps from the Windows store haven't been tampered with. All apps available through the Windows store use the Windows RTAPI, which contains significant security enhancements, such as anti-buffer overflow memory restrictions, data execution prevention (DEP), address space layout randomization, Safe Structured Exception Handling (SafeSEH), and sacrificial canary values. The Android operating system is based on the Linux kernel and is released through open source licenses. Some Android stores implement good security and tightly control their apps, much like the App store and the Windows store do. However, other Android app stores do not. If your users have devices with the Android operating system, it is strongly recommended that you require them to use apps that come from a reputable source, such as Google Play Store, Amazon App Store for Android, and Samsung Apps. Now, even though Apple, Microsoft, and Android control which apps are installed on their devices, it is possible to circumvent these protections by either jailbreaking the device or sideloading an app. Jailbreaking a device is the process of removing inherent protections placed by the device manufacturer. In the case of an Apple or Android phone, the operating system can be jailbroken in order to allow the installation of non-Apple store apps or to gain elevated root privileges. In addition, Windows and Android phones are susceptible to app sideloading. With Windows devices, this is when non-Windows store apps are installed on the Windows device. These apps have not been signed by Microsoft and could contain malware. With Android devices, you sideload by installing an application via an APK that was downloaded from the internet. Authentication and credential management are also key issues with mobile devices. The average user has to remember usernames and passwords for a variety of network resources and services, including web-based resources. To make life easier, many mobile device operating systems implement some type of credential management system that automatically stores user names and passwords for the user. When a user accesses a password-protected network resource or website the first time, credential management stores the credentials for that resource. When the user accesses that same resource again, the credential management software automatically supplies the necessary user name and password. This allows the user to automatically log in to that resource. Windows RT has a credential manager. iOS also has a similar function that uses an encrypted key chain for storing digital identities, usernames, and passwords. Android devices can use the Google ecosystem or a third-party app. Using credential management software is really convenient for the user. From a security standpoint, it presents risks. For example, suppose a user has stored credentials to a sensitive network resource or website on their mobile device, and they lose that device. Any individual who finds the device could exploit that information to gain unauthorized access, especially if the user failed to secure the device with a password or pin number. Therefore, as a best practice, train your users not to store credentials to sensitive network resources on their mobile devices. App whitelisting is another mobile device application security consideration. App whitelisting defines specific apps a user can install on a mobile device. Windows RT provides a feature called Assigned Access. Assigned Access allows you to define a list of allowed Windows Store applications. The mobile device can only have the specified apps installed. For example, the mobile device could be a point of sales system or an educational device. For those purposes, you don't want Angry Birds installed on the device. Any app that's not found on the whitelist is not allowed on the device. On iOS and Android devices, you can use a Mobile Device Management, MDM, solution to define and enforce an application whitelist. You can use an MDM solution, such as Windows Intune, to provide application whitelisting for Windows RT devices. Another key issue related to mobile device apps is geolocation data. Geolocation embeds GPS coordinates within mobile device files, such as an image or video file, created with the device's camera. If geolocation is enabled, the device's GPS location at the time the file is created is embedded within the device files. This includes all pictures taken, such as those on your vacation, with co-workers at lunch, or in your cubicle. This feature can be useful in some circumstances, but it can also create security concerns. If these pictures or videos are posted on the internet, an attacker can obtain information about you that you don't want them to have. For example, let's say a user in your organization regularly posts images with geolocation embedded to a social media site like Facebook. A cybercriminal could analyze these images and quickly discover information, such as where the user works, who they work for, and where the user's cubicle is located. A cybercriminal could even derive the user's work hours, work projects, and personal work habits, such as the restaurant they go to for lunch. All of this information can be compiled and used for social engineering attacks against the organization. Therefore, it is best practice to require that users disable the geolocation setting for mobile devices. In this lesson, we talked about mobile device application issues. We first talked about making sure you get apps from a reputable source. We talked about credential management and authentication. We looked at application whitelisting. Then we ended this lesson by talking about geotagging.",
