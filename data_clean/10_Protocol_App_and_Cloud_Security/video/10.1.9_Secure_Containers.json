In the world of IT, we are always vigilant, searching for vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit to compromise our systems. This concern isn't limited to just bare-bone servers and virtual machines; it extends to containers as well. Containers, such as this Apache web server, are streamlined versions of Linux with only the essential software required to run Apache. When we inspect the image we have in our image store, we can see that it has 32 vulnerabilities with the current container we are running. The top one is marked as \"high\" priority. The medium and low vulnerabilities are less concerning. If you wish to learn more about the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or Debian Security Advisories (DSA) associated with these vulnerabilities, you can access that information through the provided links. You can also observe the breakdown of the Docker image, which consists of multiple layers, each possibly having vulnerabilities. Now, if you examine the image closely, you'll find it comprises two parts: a base Debian image and an httpd image. Keep this in mind as we explore potential fixes. Notably, the httpd image doesn't have any updates, whereas the base image does. While you can review the recommended base image, remember that the image we downloaded can only be modified by its owner. As we are not the owner, our best course of action is to either pull down a new image or create our own image to address this issue. Let's start by attempting to pull a new image using the option to \"pull a new image.\" However, as you can see, when we exit and re-enter, there are no changes to the vulnerabilities. One potential solution is to update the running container to patch vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that if this container were deleted and rebuilt from the image, the changes we make inside the container will be lost. The primary aim is to address vulnerabilities while waiting for an updated image. As we have one running container from our Apache container image, let's proceed. Within the exec window, we can use the command line to access the Linux system inside the container. Running \"apt update\" will download the latest packages from the repository, similar to a regular Linux server. If you are wondering if the high vulnerability fix is included in these packages, you can check by running \"apt list --upgradable\" to see if it's on the list. It appears it isn't, but there are other fixes we can apply. Running \"apt upgrade\" will begin the process to upgrade the packages. Let's proceed and confirm. We'll fast forward a bit. Now our container is patched. It's a good practice to restart the container after applying patches. As mentioned earlier, this is a workaround until the image is updated with the latest patches. Each running container will receive an IP address. The network configuration may vary depending on where your containers are hosted. In our specific setting under \"resources\" and \"network,\" you can observe a Docker subnet of 192.168.65.0/24, which is the default setting. However, you may need to adjust this based on your requirements. The core concept behind network segmentation is to grant designated servers and users access only to specific network resources. For example, if our accounting department uses an Apache website container, while the marketing department does not, we can block the marketing department from using it. Adding more hurdles within the network may make it more complex, but it also reduces the attack surface for potential hackers. Simple adjustments, such as using alternate ports, can enhance security. If you examine our currently running container, you'll see it might be using port 80, but it's being redirected to port number 32771. The idea behind using alternate ports is that hackers often scan for specific port numbers. Typically, these are the default port numbers like 80 or 443 for HTTP and HTTPS. While you can't change port 443 for a regular website on the internet, you can do so on your private network. For instance, if we were to set up another Apache website, we could run it on a different port. In the optional settings, you can either allow it to select a random port or choose one yourself. Let's select \"8080\" as an alternate port to port 80. Now, if we try to launch the web page, you can see it works on port 8080. It's worth noting that this container now requires the patches applied to the previous container. There are various methods to enhance the security of your containers, and these are just a few strategies to consider when securing your network. That concludes this demonstration. In this demo, we discussed how to identify vulnerabilities within a container image. Additionally, we explored the concepts of network segmentation and the use of alternate ports for added security.",
