The days when you only had to worry about static workstations that sit in a cubicle are gone. Instead, security professionals also have to worry about countless mobile devices that can be brought in and out of office and are subject to a host of security vulnerabilities. In this lesson, we're going to take a look at some considerations you need to keep in mind when it comes to mobile devices and the threats they pose to a network. Let's first take a look at the various connection methods used by mobile devices. Mobile devices use a variety of ways to connect to the internet, the network, and even other devices. You're probably familiar with cellular and Wi-Fi connections. This is something practically all mobile devices are equipped with. However, mobile devices can also use Bluetooth, NFC, ANT, and infrared to communicate wirelessly. And each of these connection methods have their own set of security concerns you should be aware of. For example, Bluetooth is susceptible to Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing, and NFC is susceptible to relay attacks, data corruption, and eavesdropping. So, when implementing mobile devices, be sure to account for the various vulnerabilities each of these connection methods have. One way to protect against these is to simply disable these connection methods when they aren't being used. This is probably the best way to protect against attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in these systems. Another way to secure mobile device communications is to employ proper security settings and ensure the use of security protocols. For example, make sure to only allow connections with trusted devices. Another thing to consider with mobile devices is that of geolocation settings. Most mobile devices are equipped with GPS, allowing them to use geolocation services. This helps with certain apps, such as maps and weather applications. However, you can also use the GPS unit in mobile devices for security purposes. For example, using a technique called geofencing, you can lock mobile devices to a particular geographical area. You specify a geographic area where the mobile device is allowed to function a virtual boundary of sorts. If the mobile device moves outside of that area, it can either instruct the user to move back into that area, or even lock the user out from accessing the device altogether. This functionality can be useful if you issue mobile devices to employees, but don't want them to be able to take them home to use. Geofencing can also be used to trigger alerts or notifications. For example, it can be used to remind a user to carry out a particular task when they reach a geographic location. Geolocation services can be of great value to mobile devices, but they also create some security concerns. One of these concerns is that of geolocation data embedded in images. See, when someone takes a photo on their phone or mobile device, the geographic location where that photo was taken is embedded in the image's EXIF data. If the user was to upload this photo to the internet, a malicious individual could use the EXIF data to carry out a social engineering attack. To combat this, be sure to disable geotagging on mobile devices. Another concern with mobile devices is the fact that they are mobile. Because users are able to take them home, to the coffee shop, to wherever, they have the added risk of being lost or stolen. And if that device contains sensitive information or company documents, you risk compromising that information. To protect against this threat, you can do a couple of things. First, you can employ full device encryption on all mobile devices and require them to have some type of screen lock and authentication method, whether it's a pin, password, biometric, whatever. Just make sure the device requires authentication for access. Another thing you can do is require all mobile devices to have some type of remote wipe feature. Most mobile devices have built-in remote wipe features, but you might also have to install a third-party remote wipe feature if necessary. And lastly, mobile devices pose a risk for organizations in the form of data exfiltration. For example, a disgruntled employee could use their phone to take photos of sensitive information or transfer documents to their phone via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. They could even use the device to record sensitive conversations. If this is a concern for your organization, consider having an extremely strict mobile device policy or only allow the use of company-owned mobile devices on the premises. Mobile devices pose a unique threat to an organization. And mobile device use is only going to increase in the future. Because of this, it's important that you understand the threats that mobile devices pose to an organization and the steps you can take to properly protect your network.",
