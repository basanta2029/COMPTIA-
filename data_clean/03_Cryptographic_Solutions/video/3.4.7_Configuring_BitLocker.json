  "full_content": "In this demonstration, we're going to show you how to use BitLocker to encrypt a drive on Windows. Before anything else, you should know that BitLocker isn't available unless you have Windows Professional version or higher. Home version doesn't support this feature. That being said, let's go to the Start menu and type bitlocker. Clicking Manage BitLocker brings up the settings we want. Now, the first thing we have to cover in order to understand the BitLocker setup is a TPM. The TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a chip on the motherboard that's known as a cryptographic module. Basically, it's what stores your BitLocker keys. Without the TPM, you'd have to enter a long recovery key each time, especially if the BitLocker drive were installed on a computer other than the original one. It used to be common for motherboards to ship without a TPM, but as security has progressed, they're on pretty much every motherboard nowadays. In fact, a TPM is actually required with the latest versions of Windows. Okay, let's move on. Look at the TPM Administration down here. This is an area that I'd highly suggest checking first before you consider BitLocker for your system. The TPM needs to be in a ready for use status and enabled in the UEFI or BIOS. If it was previously used for BitLocker, you may have to clear the TPM chip before using it. This system we have here hasn't been encrypted before, so we don't need to do that. Also, if it isn't in a ready for use status, you'll need to use this Prepare the TPM option up here. Let's close this Window. To start the process, we need to click Turn on BitLocker. First, it'll ask us how we want to back up our recovery key. You have a few options, but we're just going to use Save to a file. When saving to a file, you're supposed to put this key on something else other than the drive being encrypted, usually something like a flash drive or network drive. We have a flash drive as drive letter E: that we can use to store this. After selecting the drive and clicking Save, it tells us that our recover key has been saved. Were able to select Next. Here we have options to encrypt just the used disk space or encrypt the entire drive. Typically, the Encrypt whole drive option takes longer because it doesn't care if space is used or not. This PC happens to be new, so we'll just choose Encrypt used disk space only. Okay, click Next. Now, Microsoft introduced a new type of encryption method with the most recent versions of Windows. We could use it, but for now, we'll just leave it set to New encryption mode. Click Next. The last part asks if you're ready to encrypt. I like to select the Run BitLocker system check just in case something ends up causing problems. In most cases, BitLocker deployment should go fine, but there are instances where it doesn't work properly. It's a good idea to have your computer backed up in some way so that your data can't be lost forever during this process. Click Continue. Now we're ready to restart the computer. You'll get a pop up that lets you know a restart is required before you can keep going with the encryption. I'm going to reboot this computer and pause the recording. Alright, after the restart, we see an option down in our taskbar that shows us that the drive is encrypting. When we click on it, it gives us a percentage of where it's at. Let's pause the recording again while this finishes. Great! Our encryption is now done, and we're ready to go. Just to show you some options you have after the encryption is complete, let's go back. You can click Manage BitLocker, or you can access it like before through the Start menu. The first option we have is Suspend protection, which means it'd put BitLocker on hold from securing your system. This might be good if Windows updates are needed and your PC is already secured with a BitLocker PIN. Make note that the BitLocker PIN won't be enabled unless you modify Group Policy and turn it on. That adds an extra layer of security, so it's definitely something to consider. Now, this isn't the same as a recovery key, as the recover key is typically 48 digits and is used as a last resort to decrypt your drive. Backup your recover key gives us the same box we had before, remember the Azure AD, Save to file, and Print options from earlier? And the last one is Turn off BitLocker. This process will take nearly the same amount of time to decrypt since it has to undo all the changes made during encryption. That's it for this demonstration on BitLocker. In this video, we talked about how to encrypt a system drive. First, we looked at the TPM and the purpose that it serves in the BitLocker process. Then we discussed which settings you have available after BitLocker has successfully encrypted a drive.",
