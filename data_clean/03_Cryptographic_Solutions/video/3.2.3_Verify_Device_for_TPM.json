  "full_content": "TPM, or Trusted Platform Module is a security device used to secure hardware. One of the most common ways is using BitLocker with a TPM. When combined, BitLocker encryption and a TPM provide more security than standard software encryption alone. To determine if your device has a TPM, you can access the BIOS. Look for an option related to Trusted Computing. Within this section, you'll find an option to enable or disable TPM. Some BIOS settings might not explicitly mention TPM, so Trusted Computing could be the option you're seeking if you don't see TPM mentioned. This concept should apply to most BIOS settings; you'll just need to locate the menu based on your motherboard model. With newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 11, TPM 2.0 is required. Most computers manufactured within the last 5 years should have this capability. If your computer is older, there's a chance it may have an older TPM module or no TPM at all. In Windows, there are several ways to verify TPM. You can navigate to the Device Manager and go to Security Devices, where you'll find a listing for TPM. If Windows cannot detect a TPM, you'll see nothing in this section. You can also check the status of this device to ensure it's functioning correctly. The key thing to look for is to ensure there are no question marks or errors associated with this device. If there are, it may indicate a device or driver issue that needs attention. Another method to check your TPM is by examining your security processor in Windows Security. Access Windows Security by typing security in the search bar, then navigate to Device Security and click on Security Processor Details. If your TPM is functioning properly, you will see related details here. In case you encounter issues with your TPM, you have the option to troubleshoot and clear TPM information. Note that you should only clear TPM if you intend to remove previously configured TPM data. There could be situations where a computer was previously used with BitLocker, and clearing the TPM may become necessary. Since we're discussing BitLocker, let's explore some settings related to it. If you navigate to BitLocker from the Start menu, you will notice that encryption is not currently enabled. One area not accessible via a Windows search bar is TPM management. If you are familiar with older versions of Windows, this window should look familiar. It offers similar options to the troubleshooting area in security, such as clearing your TPM or preparing it for use. Since the status is set to Ready to Use, you should be able to enable BitLocker and utilize TPM for enhanced security. That concludes this demonstration. In this demo, we have shown you various methods for verifying the presence of a TPM and ensuring it is ready for use with BitLocker encryption.",
