The high cost of dedicated WAN connections was one of the mains reasons for VPNs to be used by organizations. A VPN takes advantage of an existing internet connection to communicate securely between devices. Let's see how this is done. VPNs provide a secure internet connection between locations by encrypting packets in transit. A VPN uses a protocol that tunnels, or encapsulates, each of those packets into a new packet. Information in the packet header of these encrypted packets routes the information through the internet. On the destination device, the outer wrapping of the packets is removed, and the packet is decrypted—\"the data is back in its original format. If an attacker were to intercept packets sent via a VPN, they wouldn't be able to read any of the contents. Only the device on the other end has the appropriate decryption key that allows them to view the packet contents. Now, there are multiple ways that you can configure a VPN through the internet. The first way is using a host-to-host VPN. This type of VPN allows an individual host connected to the internet to establish a VPN connection to another host. With a host-to-host connection, both devices need the ability to establish and understand the VPN protocol that's used. Both devices must have the software for encrypting the packets and encapsulating the packets. Another way is using a site-to-site VPN. With a site-to-site VPN, you have a collection of computers at each location. Each computer in any location is able to communicate securely with any other computer at another location. Rather than requiring VPN configuration on every single computer, you install a single device, which acts as a gateway server. A VPN gateway is a dedicated VPN device that handles VPN connections, as well as the encryption and decryption of packets sent over the internet. The nice thing about using a VPN gateway is the protocols and encapsulation method only need to be configured and maintained on a single device for the entire network, instead of on each individual device. It also allows for all traffic between the two sites to be encrypted 100 percent of the time. The final method is a remote access VPN. In this case, individual hosts on the network can establish a VPN connection to the remote site. In this configuration, the client computer must be able to establish the VPN connection with a special device called a VPN concentrator that sits on the edge of the private network. VPN concentrators are hardware devices that are dedicated to establishing client connections, as well as encrypting and decrypting VPN packets. Each client is configured with software that allows it to encrypt packets. The VPN concentrator is configured to allow or reject connections from users. It also removes the encryption before forwarding the information to the private network. Now, VPNs can use a few different methods to establish connections and encrypt traffic. These methods are known as VPN tunneling protocols. The two most commonly used VPN tunneling protocols are IPsec and SSL. IPsec encrypts contents sent through a tunnel created by another protocol. IPsec is probably one of the most common tunneling encryption mechanisms currently used, and IPsec is actually made up of two different protocols. The first one is the Authentication Header, or AH. The second one is the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). AH is used to authentic the connection, while ESP is used to encrypt the data that's being sent through the connection. When you implement IPsec, you can use either of these protocols by themselves. For example, if you chose to implement AH only, then your VPN will have authentication, but no encryption. In most cases, you'll want to make sure that your VPN solution using IPsec includes ESP. IPsec also has two different modes for sending packets through the tunnel. The first way is called transport mode. With transport mode, IPsec only encrypts each packet's internal data. Everything else—\"the destination IP address, the origination IP address—\"is all in cleartext. The second mode is called tunneling mode. In tunneling mode, the entire packet is encrypted. It is then encapsulated in another non-encrypted packet—\"complete with a new IP header—\"and sent over the internet. Tunnel mode is usually the default sending mode for IPsec. Another protocol that can be used for a VPN connection is SSL. SSL's been around for a long time. It's been used in combination with other protocols, mostly HTTP, in order to secure traffic between two devices. For example, if you were to go to an online store and purchase a product, more than likely, you're going to use the secure version of HTTP—\"HTTPS—\"to protect the credit card information we're sending to the web server. Well, HTTPS leverages SSL to encrypt the traffic between those two devices. This makes SSL a great option for encrypting other types of connections between devices, such as a VPN connection. SSL requires certificates for identity proof, as well as for encryption. One of the benefits of using SSL is the fact that it uses port 443. This is really important because most network firewalls in most organizations are already configured to allow HTTPS traffic on this port, so we don't have to make any major firewall changes if we want to deploy an SSL VPN. There's one more VPN configuration option we need to discuss, and that is the different between split tunnel and full tunnel VPN configurations. With a split tunnel VPN, only certain types of traffic—\"for example, traffic destined for a specific IP address range—\"are sent through the VPN connection. All other traffic goes through the internet as normal. This configuration might be good for people who need to access private network resources but still want to access the internet through their own internet, and not through the VPN. It also helps reduce the amount of traffic sent through the VPN—\"instead of sending all traffic through the VPN, only necessary traffic is sent. Split tunneling also has something called inverse split tunneling. This is where all traffic is sent through the VPN except for a specific type of traffic, which is routed through the regular internet, unencrypted. The split is inverted, as its name suggests. The other way you can configure the VPN is to route all traffic through the VPN, regardless of the type of traffic. This is usually the default VPN configuration method. When you implement a VPN, be sure to select a protocol supported by all of the devices that need to encrypt or encapsulate packets. When you use a VPN through a firewall, make sure you open the necessary ports to allow the VPN traffic through the firewall. In addition, make sure you know which type of VPN connection and configuration is best for your organization.",
