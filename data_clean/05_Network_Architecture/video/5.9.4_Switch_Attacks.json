Inside attacks take advantage of anything accessible, and attackers can exploit switches to gain valuable information. It's important for you to know that all network information flows through switches and routers, including such things as authentication information and data. Attackers can use a variety of switch attacks methods to gather valuable information that they can use later to exploit the network. In this lesson, we'll go over the following attack methods: MAC flooding, ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping, STP manipulation, double tagging, and MAC spoofing in regard to Layer 2 switches. Remember, Layer 2 switches understand Ethernet frames at the OSI Data Link layer. The first attack to examine is MAC flooding. Switches maintain MAC address tables, sometimes called Content Access Memory tables, or CAM tables, to track workstations' and ports' associations. Switches learn which workstation is connected to each port, and that information is stored in the MAC address table and used when switches forward information. For example, let's say that Workstation A wants to send information to Workstation D. The frame has a source address ending in As, and the destination address is the address ending with Ds. When A sends the information, the switch examines the destination address and sends the data out port 1 to its destination. Workstations B and C aren't involved, so they never see the information. Suppose an attacker wants to see all data passing through this switch. Considering that a switch's normal operation only sends data to the intended recipient, the attacker would only be able see data destined for his or her workstation, which is very unlikely. But the attacker can flood the switch with fake MAC address information and fill up the MAC address table. Once the switch can no longer store any more MAC addresses, the switch enters a fail-open mode and behaves the same as a network hub or Layer 1 device. This means that any packet coming in now go out to all switch ports. The next switch attack is called ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning. But let's first talk about Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP, which works similarly to DNS. DNS resolves a fully qualified domain name into an IP address, while ARP associates a device's MAC address with the IP address assigned to that same device. To aid in this process, a switch creates and stores an ARP table in memory for easy lookup. Knowing this, an attacker sends commands to the switch to overwrite the contents of its ARP table by replacing a good, known MAC address in the table with the MAC address of the attacker's device. This is the ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning. As a result, data that was intended for the legitimate device is now sent to the attacker's device. In many cases, the attacker captures the data and sends it on to its rightful owner. Another attack method you should know about is VLAN hopping. VLANs are used to separate traffic into sections that function like networks. This is often done to all the different VLANS that carry different types of traffic, such as data, voice, or surveillance information. Since each VLAN is its own network, a device on one VLAN can't communicate with a device on another VLAN without a router. There are a couple of techniques attackers can use to take advantage of this VLAN separation. The first is VLAN spoofing. VLAN spoofing takes advantage of a switch that's using its default settings, which allows for dynamic trunk negotiation. Depending on the switch, this default setting is known as dynamic auto or dynamic desirable. This means that if you have a switch connected to the original switch, the ports connecting the two are automatically configured as a trunk connection. A trunk connection allows data from one switch to pass to another. A spoofing attach takes advantage of this by fooling the switch into thinking the attacker is connected using a trunk line. Although there are several ways to carry out a spoofing attach, such as adding a new switch, we'll look at how someone could accomplish a spoofing attach with just one switch. Our switch here is configured with two VLANs VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 with both having several computers connected to it. Our attacker, a disgruntled employee, is connected to VLAN 10 and wants to steal sensitive information from the company's chief executive officer. But as mentioned, VLAN 10 is a separate network from VLAN 20. So as-is, the attacker can't access the CEO's computer. By using a tool like Yersinia, our disgruntled employee can send the switch a packet that tells the switch the port he or she is using is really connected to another network switch. This is done using a Dynamic Trunking Protocol frame, or DTP frame. Since the switch is configured to auto-negotiate for a trunk line, it assumes the attacker really is a switch and opens his or her port as a trunk line. With the attacker's port now configured this way, he or she can easily capture packets from the CEO's computer. Keep in mind that the best way to protect your network from this type of attack is to disable the switch's auto-negotiation setting for all ports except those to which an authorized switch is attached. Another method attackers use is called double tagging. This VLAN hopping technique is used when the attacker's computer is on one VLAN switch, and the target computer is on a VLAN attached to a separate switch. In addition, the switches must be configured to use what's called native VLANs. When a packet is sent to a switch, it includes what's known as a VLAN tag. This tag's purpose is to indicate which switch should process the frame. For example, you'll notice that both users are on VLAN 10. If User A wants to send data to User B, the frame would include the VLAN tag indicating that the frame was intended for VLAN 10. When the data reaches the switch, the VLAN tag is removed and the packet is sent to its rightful destination. Double tagging is accomplished by manipulating the frame being sent to include two VLAN tags. So one for VLAN 10 and one for Switch 2, or VLAN 20. When this type of frame is received by VLAN 10's switch, the first VLAN tag is removed. But seeing that the second VLAN tag is referencing VLAN 20, the frame is forwarded to that switch. Then, as it normally would, this switch strips off the second VLAN tag and sends the frame to the victim's VLAN, successfully hopping from one VLAN to another. To prevent double tagging, it's important to make sure that your switches aren't configured to use native VLANs. This is because trunk ports configured with a native VLAN won't apply their own VLAN tag when sending these frames, which lets the attacker's tagged frames to continue as I just described. Another common switch attack is known as a Spanning Tree Protocol, or STP, manipulation attack. STP is normally configured on a network with several switches. The primary purpose is to prevent switching loops. Often, whether intentional or not, there are several paths data can take to get from its source to its destination. STP dynamically turns off certain switch ports to ensure that data can't get stuck hopping from switch to switch without ever reaching its intended target. While STP configuration is beyond the scope of this lesson, it's important to understand that a single switch is designated as the root bridge. The root bridge is an optimized data path's primary source. This is necessary because some switches often connect to other switches to form redundant connections to ensure communications continue even if a switch or port fails. The root bridge is used to pass data from switch to switch since all switches that participate in the tree know where the root bridge is located. So the root bridge is responsible for calculating the spanning tree from topology changes advertised by non-root bridges. If an attacker can become the root bridge, he or she is then able to see a variety of frames that they normally wouldn't see. To perpetrate this attack, the attacker inserts their switch into the tree and manipulates it to appoint his or her switch as the root bridge. By doing this, he or she can use a sniffer to collect data traversing the network. An attacker accomplishes this manipulation by sending bridge ID frames, or BID frames, with a lower ID than that currently being used by the legitimate root bridge. There are several step you can take to mitigate this type of attack. First, make sure that attackers can't easily guess which bridge ID number is being used by the legitimate root bridge. Most switches have a default root bridge ID, ensuring that your bridge ID is considerably lower than the default one. If your switch supports it, a second option is to set up Bridge Protocol Data Units Guard, or BPDU Guard. This feature allows an interface to put itself into blocking state when it receives a BPDU packet meant to change the root bridge switch. Your third option is to enable Root Guard on the ports not being used as trunk lines. This keeps ports in their assigned roles. If one of these ports receives a BPDU frame, a sys error is logged and that port is blocked, thwarting the attacker's attempt to change the root bridge. The last common switch attack to discuss is known as MAC spoofing. MAC spoofing is the process of sending out data from a computer using a MAC address that's different from the MAC address physically hard-coded on a network interface card, or NIC. Although you can't physically change your MAC address, there are tools like Windows Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel, SMAC for Windows, and others that can make an operating system believe that the NIC has a different MAC address. There are several reasons attackers may use this method to attack a network, such as to defeat switch port security. For example, in some networks, part of a switch's security is the creation of a whitelist of MAC addresses. Only devices with a MAC address in the whitelist can be processed through that switch. If an attacker can use a network sniffer to find a MAC address that's being used by a legitimate host attached to the switch, he or she can change their MAC address to a valid one on the whitelist. Then they've successfully gained access to the switch and any data being transmitted through it. An attacker could use MAC spoofing to change their MAC address to mimic a targeted system as well. For example, once an attacker has assumed a valid computer's MAC address, he or she could send the switch a MAC update command, changing the MAC address table. Now, the switch sends any data that was destined for the target system to the attacker's system. The important thing to know here is that since it's controlled on the attacker's computer, there really isn't a way to prevent MAC spoofing. If this becomes an issue, you'll need to use techniques at the Application level of the OSI model. As we end this lesson, you've probably noticed that for any of these attacks to work, the attacker must have physical network access. So physical security is a must! One thing to keep in mind is that for every offense, there's a defense. Administrators can make configuration settings that help to avoid some of these attacks or, at least, notify them something strange is going on. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we examined several methods attackers utilize to exploit switch configuration weaknesses, such as the ones shown here. With each of these attacks, one of the primary goals is to collect information that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities at a later time.",

      "summary": "MAC spoofing involves altering a device's MAC address to impersonate another device on a network, allowing attackers to bypass security measures like MAC address whitelisting. Tools can facilitate this process, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access to network resources by mimicking legitimate devices. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement strong physical security measures and configure network settings to detect and respond to suspicious activities.",
