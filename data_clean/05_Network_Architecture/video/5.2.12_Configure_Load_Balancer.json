Some examples could include websites, web services, email, print servers, and much more. Not only can it serve the purpose of load balancing, but it can also be used for failover. Today, we're going to be using a software load balancer called Kemp. This is an easy-to-install software load balancer deployed to VMware with an .ovf template. One of the first things you must do is configure a Virtual Service. The virtual service will have an IP address associated with it. This is simply the IP address that users will connect to instead of the real server addresses where load balancing occurs. Our Virtual Address will be 192.168.30.31, which is outside our DHCP zone. Port 80 will be used since this is just an HTTP website. We can also add a Service Name so we know what this is for. Templates are useful because they help predefine some settings related to the type of service you're load balancing. These can be obtained from Kemp's website, as you can see here. This example shows Apache and Tomcat templates, but as we scroll up, there are many different types of services that we can load balance with Kemp. Let's go back to our load balancer. We'll select the Apache HTTP template and then click Add this Virtual Service. When this service is added, there are several options available, such as quality of service or limiting. These options can help ensure that the service you're load balancing isn't overloaded. The default is 0, which means off. Advanced settings can also assist with tasks such as redirecting or enabling caching. At the bottom is where we'll add our real servers. These are the actual web servers that we'll be load balancing. When we click Add New, we'll input our first web server, 192.168.30.10, and then click Add This Real Server. Our second one will be 192.168.30.11. Both web servers will use port 80 since they're serving only HTTP websites. The Forwarding method will remain as NAT since that's the only option. The Weight can be adjusted if you want to send more traffic to one server over the other. For now, we've left them both at 1000. One useful feature is that when you hover over these options, it provides a description to help you configure them. Connection Limit and Connection Rate Limit can be set, but we won't be doing that today. Click Add This Real Server. After clicking OK, you can see that we have two real servers now configured for this virtual service. We need to make some more changes for this virtual service to work correctly. If we go to View/Modify Services, we can see the virtual service we've created. Clicking Modify on the right will allow us to go back into the settings. Down at the bottom, we need to set the URL we're looking to load balance. Since our web servers don't have a website at the root directory, we need to add /test.html to the URL area. Next, click Set URL. Now, we're ready to test out load balancing with our websites. If we open a new tab, we can go to http://192.168.30.10/test.html. This will show us our first web server, and if we modify the address and change the 10 to 11, we'll access our second web server. In a real-world scenario, the websites on both servers would be identical; however, we've made them different so you can tell which server you're on during load balancing. Now that we know our web servers work, let's use our virtual IP address. If we go back to our load balancer, it can detect that both web servers are online. Our virtual IP will be 192.168.30.31. Let's go there. When we type it in, you can see that it's directing us to webserver-svp01. A common thing we can do with a virtual IP is associate it with a DNS name. On our Pi-hole DNS server, we can scroll down and go to Local DNS and DNS Records. You can already see that we have records for our web servers, so let's add a record for our virtual IP. The domain will be testwebsite.com, and our virtual IP address is 192.168.30.31. After clicking Add, it will add it to the list of records. Let's test this out. In our web tab, we'll remove the IP address and enter testwebsite.com, then click Enter. Great, it still shows webserver-svp01. To make things more interesting, let's force traffic to go to webserver-svp02 since we have maintenance to attend to on webserver-svp01. If we go back to our load balancer tab and Modify our virtual service, we can go down to our real servers and click Disable on webserver-svp01. Once this is disabled, we can go back and test. Please note that many browsers cache websites, so in order for this change to be visible right away, we must open a new private browsing window. Now, if we enter our web address testwebsite.com/test.html, we can see that it's now showing webserver-svp02. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we showed you how to configure a load balancer, add web servers to the load balancer, and test both IP and DNS with our web servers.",
