Don't confuse the ACL on a router with its routing table. The routing table is used to determine where network packets are forwarded to. The ACL, on the other hand, is used to determine whether or not a packet is allowed to be forwarded. For example, an ACL on a router could ban all incoming traffic destined to a specific IP address inside the network. Any packet destined for that IP address is dropped. However, outgoing packets from that IP address are still permitted. When you create an ACL on a router, it almost always includes a hidden deny any statement at the end of the list. This means all traffic is automatically blocked. To allow traffic, you need at least one permit statement that either permits a specific traffic type or permits all traffic not specifically restricted. The type of traffic you are able to control with an ACL depends on the type of ACL you create. Routers primarily use two ACL types: standard ACLs and extended ACLs. A standard ACL is only able to filter traffic based on the source host name or host IP address--that is, it can't filter traffic based on port number, destination host name, or host IP address. For example, you could configure a standard ACL to only allow traffic coming from internal IP addresses. All traffic coming from external IP address would be dropped. You could also configure a standard ACL to block all traffic from a specific IP address, but allow all other traffic. Know that because of how they function, standard ACLs should be placed as close to the destination as possible. So, what if you wanted to block traffic based on other parameters, such as port number? To do this, you use the second type of ACL—\"an extended ACL. Extended ACLs are used to filter traffic based on a lot more parameters than standard ACLs. In addition to filtering based on source host name or host IP address, an extended ACL can filter based on source IP protocol, source or destination socket number, and destination host name or host IP address. For example, you could block all outgoing traffic except for traffic on ports 80 and 443, or you could block all traffic from inside the network that's destined for a specific IP address. Unlike standard ACLs, extended ACLs should be placed as close to the source as possible. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at router ACLs. We looked at how ACLs on a router work and what parameters are defined when they are created. We then looked at the two types of ACLs routers use, standard ACLs and extended ACLs.",

      "summary": "Router Access Control Lists (ACLs) serve as a security measure to protect networks by regulating the types of communications permitted, similar to a firewall. Unlike a routing table, which directs packet forwarding, ACLs specifically assess and determine whether packets can be transmitted based on predefined rules. Understanding and implementing ACLs is crucial for enhancing network security and controlling traffic flow.",
