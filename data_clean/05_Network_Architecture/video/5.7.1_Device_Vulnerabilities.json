For this reason, security professionals must do all they can to reduce the attack surface their company presents. In this lesson, I'll discuss several methods for reducing your attack surface and creating a company profile that's as secure as possible. Let's first look as some often-misconfigured devices that may open up opportunities for an attack. Remember that your attack surface increases each time a device is added to your network. This provides threat actors more opportunities to find openings in your network shield. These malicious users continually look for entry points, so it's important to ensure that each new device is properly configured and protected. For example, firewalls are one of those entry points that are often misconfigured. Knowing this, attackers often look for firewalls with too many open ports or other security weaknesses. In addition, servers or appliances that are set up to block malicious payloads in emails could let spam and malware into the company if not configured properly. This could lead to data loss or corruption. Wireless access points are another area that, if not configured appropriately, could lead to potential attacks by allowing attackers into the production network. Using weak or outdated security protocols such as WEP is an open invitation for attackers. Once they have access to the internal network, the damage quotient is critically high. Another attack surface to be aware of is security. The old adage says, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\" Attackers are experts at finding the smallest hole or chink in the armor. If they want in, they'll get in. The question is how difficult it'll be for them. Unfortunately, when something works, it's often difficult to make changes. For compatibility reasons, administrators might use outdated and insecure security protocols such as SHA1 and WEP. So every effort to utilize updated and secure protocols such as 3DES, SHA-256, and AES should be made. Another easy security attack comes from using the default credentials for your network devices, such as routers. Most attackers find that a 10 second Google query can provide the default username and password for commonplace devices. With little effort, an attacker can usually discover the make and model of the device he or she wants to attack. Those are the credentials they'll try first. To help overcome this weakness, some manufacturers are becoming more security conscious and require a change to the defaults as part of the installation process. Others make their device inoperable until the default configuration credentials are changed. As computer networking professionals, we're very familiar with operating system and application software updates. These updates provide the latest patches, add functionality, and close security holes. The same is true for firmware. Firmware updates might include protocol updates that enable newer, more secure encryption. As an example, the famous WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017 took advantage of a weakness inherent in the SMBv1 Protocol that allowed a remote attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This could've been prevented with security-minded updates. Now, let's look at credential management. Unfortunately, some administrators use the same credentials in an attempt to ease the device management burden. Even though the new credentials might be different from the default ones, doing this is still a massive security risk. It might be convenient, but if any one device becomes comprised, the attacker then has access to all device configurations. Your network is greatly compromised when this happens, and you might even have to reset all your devices to factory defaults and reconfigure them. Another potential vulnerability concern is the use of discretionary credentials. The principle of least privilege is paramount here. Users should only be given credentials with permissions that match their specific job responsibilities. If a user is given more privileges than he or she needs, an attacker could use their account to find much more potentially sensitive data than would otherwise be the case. Next, let's go over physical access. If someone is given physical access to a device, there's very little opportunity for protection. For example, an attacker can change passwords or add credentials to a firewall with physical access. Or they can use a USB flash drive to copy data or inject malware. As such, you should confine infrastructure equipment to secure areas that only authorized personnel have access to. In addition, you should make sure that any attempted access without proper credentials sets off alarms and alerts. One of the hard things about keeping your devices safe is trying to protect them from unknown vulnerabilities. Unknown vulnerabilities are often referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability is a software security weakness that's unknown to the developer. Since these vulnerabilities are unknown, attackers who discover them quietly try to continue exploiting them without detection. Once brought to the developers' attention, they'll obviously want to fix them as quickly as possible. The best way to protect yourself from zero-day vulnerabilities is to keep your software updated. When a zero-day vulnerability is announced, patch it as quickly as possible. Keeping up with the vastness of known vulnerabilities is also a monumental task. Fortunately, there's some help available for network administrators. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, has a publication that serves as a national database of known vulnerabilities. In addition, they provide vulnerability metrics called the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS. The NIST website states that CVSS is an open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. After evaluating known vulnerabilities, CVSS produces a score from zero to ten, letting you calculate the vulnerability's severity. This score helps you determine the best course of action to take. Another method of knowing about vulnerabilities is to use the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system, or CVE system. The system's goal is to make it easier to share information about known vulnerabilities across organizations. This is done by creating unique, standardized CVE identifiers to let you access information about specific cyber threats across multiple information sources. You can download CVE lists in several different formats. As of the writing of this lesson, there are well over 175,000 identified vulnerabilities. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed the need for enterprises to protect their infrastructure. Some best practices to ensure protection are to not use outdated firmware, default configurations, or weak security settings. Additionally, systems administrators need to make sure that software patches are applied in a timely manner and that bad credential management practices, like discretionary credentials, are avoided. Since securing physical access points is critical to an organization's survival, you must have an airtight infrastructure in place to do this. Finally, we talked about a few resources available to help you catalog and identify common vulnerabilities and exposures.",
