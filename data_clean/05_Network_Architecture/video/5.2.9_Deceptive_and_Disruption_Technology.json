  "full_content": "In this lesson we'll discuss attack deceptions. By now you should have a clear understanding of what an attack is and what it looks like. Threat agents are working hard to find weaknesses in your defenses. They will exploit any vulnerability to gather information from an organization's network system. Knowing this, organizations can set up data or add devices to their networks that lures unsuspecting attackers into attacking devices. The attacking devices are designed to trap attackers and prevent them from exfiltrating any useful information. The first item we'll look at is the honeypot. As the name implies, if you look inside, you'll find will find something sweet. A honeypot is a network set up to fool an attacker into thinking he's attacking a network device critical to your company; however, it's simply a ruse. The attacker can attack the honeypot as long as he wants and get as deep as he wants; however, there is no prize or honey in the end. A honeypot can be a host, a service on a host, a network device, a virtual entity, or even a single file set up to attract attackers to a secure area away from an organization's real network. Even better, while it's distracting the attacker, you can monitor the malicious activity to learn what the attacker is trying to do. For example, if an attacker attempts an exploit or upload a rootkit or Trojan to a server, the honeypot environment will safely store those files for malware collection and analysis. There are several types of honeypots that are designed to mimic and trap different types of attacks. Each honeypot falls into one of two categories: research or production. Research honeypots are typically used by research, military, or government organizations to gather information about the motives and tactics of the attackers. They are also used for educational purposes. Production honeypots are used, primarily by private and public organizations. Let's look at a few examples of production honeypots. First, you have the SSH honeypots. SSH honeypots are designed to trap brute force attacks that attempt to guess the password of a targeted device. Perhaps more importantly, this type of honeypot captures the complete shell history performed by the attacker. Next, we have HTTP honeypots. This type of honeypot is used to trap different types of web vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, file insertions, and web application attacks. We also have WordPress honeypots which are designed to attract spam and adware attacks. An email honeypot is used to attract SMTP-based attacks such as open relay, DDoS, and spam attacks. And lastly, there are several types of honeypots designed for TCP/IP-based protocol attacks. To make things more enticing to the attackers, many companies will create a decoy network and fill it with one or more honeypots. This is known as a honeynet. The information gained from a honeynet attack serves to strengthen an organization's defense against future attack. Similar in concept to a honeypot, a honeyfile is a single file setup to entice and trap attackers and to figure out what they're trying to do. These types of files are typically set up on a file server, and when accessed, an alarm is set off notifying that administrators of the attack. These types of alarms are often sent by email directly to the user, which can also be easily seen on a phone and almost instantly interpreted. Honeyfiles are named so the hacker will try and open or execute them. For example, files with names such as passwords.txt or IP Assignments.xls are prized targets for hackers to gain useful information about a user or system. When it comes to honeyfiles, attackers are typically interested in four types of files. First, are the informational files. These are the types of files that contain information about access other systems, like a password.txt file, and security files like Microsoft word file named vpn_instructions. The second type are application or program files that an attacker may run, but the normal user wouldn't, such as a complier. Third, hackers love to attack files that contain evidence of an attack such as log files. The last type of file commonly targeted by attackers are files that might contain intellectual property such as a forecast, credit card numbers, and product roadmaps. As you can see, honeyfiles protect a wide variety of files and systems including email and email attachments. Although we've pointed out the four major types of file that attack hackers, keep in mind that any file can be used as a honeyfile. Honeyfiles also work with network intrusion detection systems, or NIDS, and help to prevent false positives. The other nice thing about honeyfiles is that if end users are properly trained, they can create their own honeyfiles and set up their own alarms and alerts. Enabling users makes the detection process easy and deployment effectiveness is high. Since users create their own honeyfiles, they receive the alarm if they accidentally access one of their own monitored files. This virtually eliminates false positives that have be investigated. This saves time, effort, and energy for system management charged with keeping the network secure. Further, this process supports a defense-in-depth strategy. Now let's shift gears and discuss DNS sinkholes. Simply put, a DNS sinkhole is used to provide false information for DNS queries. Although this may sound counterintuitive, providing false information can help to prevent a denial-of-service or distributed denial-of-service attack. DNS sinkholes are an effective measure that blocks malicious traffic and blocks bots from successfully taking a site down using a DDoS attack. It's important to understand that a DNS sinkhole is not a product. Instead, it's a method used by system management to fool an attacker by providing bogus information. For example, suppose a bot attempts to use DNS to forward information. The DNS server returns fake information and the bot can't continue its malicious activity. As another example, supposed an attacker sends a malicious email to an unsuspecting user. Should the user click the link in the email, the DNS sinkhole would prevent the attack by resolving the DNS query to a false site. Creating a DNS sinkhole is not without its limitations. To work correctly, the malware must use the organization's DNS server. If it uses a public DNS server or its own DNS server, this won't work. You can mitigate this by configuring firewalls to block DNS queries going outside the perimeter. It's also important to understand that a sinkhole doesn't prevent malware and can't prevent malware execution or remove malware from the system. However, the DNS server will be configured with potential malware sites. Creating a sinkhole can take time. Even if obtained from trusted internet sources, its possible legitimate sites are used to forward malicious content. This could result in restrictions to legitimate websites. Therefore, sinkholes should be internal only. If attackers can access the DNS server externally, they can change entries in the sinkhole and use it to their benefit. While many threat agents are looking for open and available vulnerabilities, others are looking to infiltrate a network's defenses and either copy intellectual property or damage internal systems. It's truly a cat and mouse game played by attackers and network managers. Attackers are always trying new techniques to perform their reconnaissance and discover weakness they can exploit. One method used by system managers is the concept of fake telemetry. Telemetry is defined as the collection of data at remote points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment for monitoring. As such, organizations provide false data, meant to deceive the attacker. This type of fake information might include fake credentials or fake IP address information. It might be an internal report detailing vulnerable systems that require updates when, they are really honeypots designed to capture attacker information. The primary reason for providing fake information is to get the attacker to act on the false information. Since the information is controlled by system managers, they can utilize alerts, alarms, and logs to track the techniques and tools used by an attacker. The tracked information allows system management to tune perimeter equipment such as firewalls, NIDS, NIPS and other protections. That's it for this lesson. In this video, we discussed deception techniques used by companies to protect themselves from attackers. We discussed such techniques as using honeypots, honeyfiles, and honeynets to lure attackers into fake areas. We also discussed the benefits of using DNS sinkholes. And we ended this lesson outlining the benefits of companies using fake telemetry.",
