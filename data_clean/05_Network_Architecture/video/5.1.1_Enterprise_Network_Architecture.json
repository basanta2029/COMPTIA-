  "full_content": "In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of network design, from architecture decisions to device placement. Let's get started! Network architecture is like the blueprint of a network. It involves choosing and arranging components such as media, devices, protocols or services, and data assets. Within this framework, we have network infrastructure, which consists of the physical elements like cables, appliances, and addressing and forwarding protocols that enable basic connectivity. Network applications are the services running on this infrastructure to support business activities like processing invoices or sending emails. Data assets are the information generated as a result of these activities. The goal of secure network infrastructure and application architecture is to support secure business workflows, where security means ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Let's take the example of provisioning email services to understand the architecture decisions involved. Access control ensures that client devices access the network through a secure channel with authentication and authorization. Unauthorized users and devices must be denied access. The email mailbox server stores data assets securely and must be accessible only to authorized clients. It should also be fault-tolerant and highly available. The mail transfer server, responsible for connecting with untrusted internet hosts, requires careful control to manage communications between the untrusted network and trusted LAN. Any data or software leaving or entering the network must be subject to policy-based controls. This type of business flow will involve systems with different security requirements. Placing the client, the mailbox, and the mail transfer server all within the same segment will introduce many vulnerabilities. Understanding and controlling how data flows between these network segments is a key part of secure and effective network architecture design. Now, let's dive into network infrastructure using the OSI model, a framework for understanding network layers. At the physical layer (Layer 1), we find various transmission media, from cables to wireless signals, which are the links connecting network nodes. Now, nodes come in two types: host nodes, which initiate data transfers (like servers or clients), and intermediary nodes that forward traffic around the network. Networks can vary in scope, from local area networks (LANs) for a single site to wide area networks (WANs) that span metropolitan, country-wide, or global scopes. Each network node must have a unique address, and this addressing function occurs at different layers and scopes. Various network appliances and protocols handle forwarding and addressing functions, such as switches, routers, transport protocols, application protocols, and DNS servers. When designing a network, several factors come into play. Costs, including upfront investments and ongoing maintenance, need to be considered. Compute resources affect processing time for various workloads. Scalability and ease of deployment help manage changes in workload. Availability and resilience minimize downtime and recovery time in case of failures. Facility power usage capabilities and patch availability are also vital considerations, along with the option of risk transference through service-level agreements. These factors together shape the architecture of your network. The selection of effective controls for network infrastructure is the process of choosing the type and placement of security appliances and software. The aim is to enforce segmentation, apply access controls, and monitor traffic for policy violations. Guided by the principle of defense in depth, diverse controls are placed at different OSI layers to enhance security. You have three options: preventive controls at network borders, detective controls within the perimeter, and a combination of preventive, detective, and corrective controls on hosts. For instance, a firewall at the network border enforces access rules, while a sensor behind it relays traffic to an intrusion detection system for monitoring. Access control lists on internal routers enforce rules for traffic between zones, and load balancers can help mitigate denial-of-service attacks. Endpoint protection software on hosts adds another layer of security, implementing host firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion detection, and data loss prevention. Lastly, attributes determine the precise way in which a device can be placed within the network topology. Controls can be active or passive. Active controls require configuration and data exchange, while passive controls operate silently. Deployment can be inline, becoming part of the network path, or as taps or monitors, capturing traffic transparently. The router/firewall is an active control as client devices must be configured to use it for internet access. The TAP and mirror ports are passive controls. They're completely transparent to the server and client hosts. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed network architecture and how it's the blueprint of your network design. We then talked about how the network infrastructure fits within the architecture framework. We used the OSI model to help us understand how different components of the infrastructure fit together. Next, we reviewed the many architecture considerations that factor into your network design. We also discussed device placement and security controls. We finished this lesson by looking at device attributes that determine how a security control affects device placement.",
