There's VPN software built into Windows 10 that works really well. We're going to go down to the Start button and choose the Settings option. Inside the Settings option, notice that there's a category for Network and Internet, and inside of this category, there's a node for VPN. We can create a VPN connection, and we can choose to allow this VPN connection over metered networks. This means if we're connecting, maybe via cellular, and this is going to be a charge per gigabyte of data that we transfer, we're going to permit the VPN over this type of connection. We'll also permit the VPN while we're roaming with the system by default, so we'll choose the add a VPN connection button, and then we can choose the VPN provider. Let's say that we're using the built-in functionality of VPNs with Windows as our VPN provider, and we're going to say this is 'CorpNetVPN'. Then we'll provide the IP address or the fully qualified domain name as long as it's registered in your DNS system for the VPN server. This is typically information that you're going to provide your end users so that they can successfully make the VPN connection. For the VPN type, often, we'll configure it to be automatic, and we'll have given the instructions to this client for how to connect. But notice you can also configure it so that it's preset for the VPN type. A popular option here is IKE version 2. This would be used with IPSec VPN connections, for example. You can easily use a smart card, a one-time password, a certificate, or a username and password for verification. We'll do a dfellows username and a password that's extra strong. Once the correct information is entered, we'll save it, and now have a CorpNet VPN connection. We can connect at any time we'd like, or we could go in the advanced options and edit the properties of this connection, clear the sign-in info, or specify that we need to use a VPN proxy. This is a device we'd go to for establishing the VPN on our behalf. We can easily remove any VPN connection that we've created inside of this settings area, provided that we have the appropriate permissions inside of Windows 10. That's it for this demo. We discussed how easy it is to establish a VPN connection inside of Windows 10.",
