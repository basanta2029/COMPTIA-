If you're responsible for managing routers, it is critical that you use a secure router configuration. The way you do this depends on router manufacturer, model, configuration interface, and other factors. In this lesson, we're going to look at some general router security principles that apply to a wide variety of router makes and models. The most important aspect of securing any router, regardless of manufacturer, is changing default configuration settings. By default, routers are configured to use a predetermined username and password. Typically, this is something like admin and admin, or admin and password, or something very similar. There's actually even lists out on the internet that have the default username and password for practically every router model. Because of this, it's extremely important you immediately change the default username and password on a router. In fact, I would recommend you changing this configuration before you even connect the router to the rest of the network or internet. This will ensure that there is zero chance someone will compromise the router before you have a chance to change this configuration. When you're changing the default username, make sure to name it something other than admin or administrator or root or something easily guess. Also make sure you use a very complex password that includes numbers, symbols, upper- and lower-case letters, and is at minimum 12 characters long. Another default setting you might consider changing is the default network address. Depending on how your organization is configured, you might have the ability to select a different IP address range than the default 192.168.1 network address that most routers use. This approach is known as security through obscurity, which by itself isn't actually secure, but if layered with other security techniques, it can add just one more obstacle an attacker has to get through, albeit a small one. Depending on the device or organization you work for, you might be using a SOHO all-in-one router that includes switching and Wi-Fi capabilities. If this is the case, make sure to change the default SSID name and wireless encryption settings. Another thing you should do when you first set up a router is make sure the firmware is up-to-date. Oftentimes routers are shipped with older firmware versions. Firmware updates contain much needed security fixes and vulnerability fixes, so it's important you are using the latest firmware version available. And always make sure you keep the router updated with the latest firmware. The next configuration changes you want to make is that of the protocol used to connect to the router. Some routers use connection protocols that send authentication credentials in cleartext. This makes it very easy for someone to capture packets and identify the login information for the device. While most modern routers will use some type of secure protocol, such as SSL, it's possible you might work with an older router that uses an older, unencrypted protocol by default. If this is the case, be aware that you should use a secure protocol. For example, some routers might have FTP functionality that allows you to upload configuration files or firmware updates to the router. Because FTP is an unencrypted transmission protocol, the configuration file could be easily captured. Instead, you might be able to use SFTP, which is the secure, encrypted form of FTP. Now, this does all depend on how you are connecting to the router to configure it. Some routers have a dedicated serial port that is used to configure the router. This is done instead of a remote configuration portal using a web browser or SSH. If this is the case, you might not need to worry about encrypted transmissions. However, if you are working with the router remotely, be sure you know which transmission protocol is being used and whether or not it is secure. Speaking of using secure protocols, there's one protocol that I want to quickly talk about that some routers use, especially SOHO routers. That protocol is universal plug and play (UPnP). UPnP was designed to make setting up media and IoT devices, such as smart TVs and gaming consoles, a breeze. It works by opening up ports for devices inside the network on the fly, eliminating the need to manually open up ports for these devices. In theory, it's a nice idea. However, in practice? Not so much. UPnP has been plagued with exploit after exploit since it was implemented. These exploits range from annoying to downright scary. Because of this, I highly recommend simply disabling UPnP on any router that has it. At this time, the convenience isn't worth the risk. Another area you need to look at with routers is that of remote access. Most routers will allow you to configure remote access optionsâ€”both remote access from within the network and remote access from outside the network via the internet. It might not be possible to disable remote access from inside the network. For example, the router might be locked inside of a networking closet or server rack case and accessing the router would require you to be inside the frigid server room. If this is the case, make sure the login credentials for remote access are configured properly and the protocol used is secure. Remote access from outside, on the other hand, should 99% of the time be disabled. There are really only a handful of times remote access from outside the network would be necessary. And for these occasions, I recommend only enabling for as long as you need it, and not a moment longer. Allowing remote access from outside the network opens up entire attack surface that you shouldn't have to worry about. Like I said earlier, you might not be able to have physical access to the router all the time, and this is actually a good thing. As you already know, it's always a good idea to keep networking devices and critical infrastructure components under lock and key, and routers are no different. With physical access, it's possible for an attacker to access a router even if they don't have the proper login credentials. Because of this, make sure routers are stored in a secure location. At the very least, keep the router in a locked cabinet. But keeping it with other networking equipment in a locked cage or lock server room that has the appropriate physical security controls is best. Another important aspect of proper router security is that of the configuration file. The configuration file stores all the configure settings for the router, including open ports, usernames, firewall settings, et cetera. And often times these files can be backed up remotely on a USB drive or workstation. If you do backup these files, be sure to properly encrypt them so they can't easily read. In addition, a lot of routers offer the option to encrypt the configuration file on the device itself. If your router happens to have this option, enable it. This provides an additional layer of security should someone gain access to this file. And speaking of backing up the configuration file, do so on a regular basis. And as I said earlier, secure you backups by encrypting them. Your network is only as strong as its weakest link. And if that weak link is the primary entry point into your network, as the router is, you might have a lot of problems on your hands. Keep this in mind when securing your network and take the extra time and steps we discussed in this lesson to properly secure your router.",
