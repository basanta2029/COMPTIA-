When you install a new network device, it's almost always going to have some sort of default administrative account with an associated password. You can find these by doing a search for default network device passwords, like I did up here. Some states and countries require unique passwords for each device. Here's the website for the State of California Legislature. If I scroll down, you can see where I highlighted this line, \"The preprogrammed password is unique to each device manufactured.\" That means in order to sell devices in this state, I have to make sure each one has a unique password. Since these sort of laws have been implemented, most manufactures are doing this for devices sold anywhere, which is a good practice. But not all devices come with unique passwords, especially enterprise equipment. On legacy equipment, having default passwords presents a security issue because these usernames and passwords are very well known and very easy to find. If someone learns your device's make and model and you haven't changed the default password, they could cause some serious damage. Let's say we have a Netgear router, and we want to find out what the default password is. Well, I did a search, like we already saw, and here are some of the sites I found. This first one, CIRT.net, is a pretty good site. It has over 2,100 default passwords on it. And if we come down here, we can find Netgear, and you can see a variety of different makes and models. It looks like for admin, password is a common default password for Netgear. Let's check out another one, datarecovery.com. I'll press Ctrl+F to do a search and type in ‘netgear'. I'll move down, and we can see a list of Netgear devices. Once again, you can see the usernames and passwords. This one's credentials are admin and password. Let's look at one more site. This one is routerpasswords.com. I can come down and look for our Netgear devices again. I'll click on Find Passwords and see the variety of different Netgear network devices they've listed. On this site, it looks like most of the default usernames and passwords are admin and password, although there is some variance. We can also see how you interface with the device, whether it's over a web browser using HTTP, FTP, or some other way. That's it for this demo. We searched the web for some default usernames and passwords for network devices. Remember, always change the default username and password on new network devices. Leaving default credentials presents a huge security risk.",
