  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 This lesson covers the following topics: Common switch attacks Switch hardening Implementing secure protocols Common Switch Attacks The following table describes common attacks that are perpetrated against switches. Attack Description MAC flooding MAC flooding overloads the switch's MAC forwarding table to make the switch function like a hub. MAC flooding is performed using the following method: The attacker floods the switch with packets, each containing a different source MAC address. The flood of packets fills up the forwarding table and consumes so much of the memory in the switch that it causes the switch to enter a state called fail open mode. In fail open mode, all incoming packets are broadcast out to all ports (as with a hub), instead of to the designated port (as a switch normally does). The attacker then captures all the traffic with a protocol analyzer/sniffer. ARP spoofing/poisoning ARP spoofing/poisoning associates the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of victim's device. When computers send an ARP request for the MAC address of a known IP address, the attacker's system responds with its MAC address. The source device sends frames to the attacker's MAC address instead of the correct device. Switches are indirectly involved in the attack because they do not verify the MAC address/IP address association. A default gateway is a prime target because local traffic goes through a default gateway to get to non-local destinations such as the internet. When the attacker's system MAC address receives packets intended for the default gateway, the attacker can: Forward the packets to the actual default gateway (passive sniffing). Modify data in the packets before forwarding it (man-in-the-middle). MAC spoofing MAC spoofing is changing the source MAC address on frames. The attacker's system sends frames with the spoofed MAC address. The switch reads the source address contained in the frames and associates the MAC address with the port where the attacker is connected. MAC spoofing can be used to: Bypass 802.1x port-based security. Bypass wireless MAC filtering. Hide the identity of the attacker's computer or to impersonate another device on the network. Impersonate a device on the network to capture frames addressed to that device. Impersonate a valid device on the network to gain network access. For example, to gain access when the switch is using the MAC address to allow or deny a network connection. Dynamic Trunking Protocol Switches have the ability to automatically detect trunk ports and negotiate the trunking protocol used between devices. The Dynamic Trunking Protocol is not secure and allows unauthorized devices to possibly modify configuration information. You should disable the DTP services on the switch's end user (access) ports before implementing the switch configuration into the network. Switch Hardening Examples of changes designed to improve the security of switches from the default settings include the following: Change Default Credentials that are well documented and pose a significant security risk. Disable Unnecessary Services and Interfaces on a switch or router. Not every service or interface is needed. For example, services like HTTP or Telnet should be avoided. Use Secure Management Protocols such as SSH instead of Telnet or HTTPS instead of HTTP. Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the switch to only required devices and networks. Enable Logging and Monitoring to help identify issues like repeated login failures, configuration changes, and many others. Configure Port Security helps limit the devices that can connect to a switch port to prevent unauthorized access. Strong Password Policies help reduce the risk of password attacks. Physically Secure Equipment like keeping devices in a locked room to prevent unauthorized physical access. Implementing Secure Protocols Organizations usually follow formal processes when selecting secure protocols to ensure comprehensive documentation and well-informed decision-making. These processes include assessing risks, reviewing policies, and evaluating the security features of different protocols. Organizations may also consult with technical experts or vendors for recommendations. The outcomes of these processes are documented, which is useful for audits and compliance reviews. Additionally, these process outcomes will typically impact security baselines and configuration management systems. Selecting protocols, assigning ports, setting transport methods, and other security considerations require careful consideration. The first step requires evaluating the data type used and its sensitivity level. Organizations should select secure protocols like HTTPS, SSH, and SFTP/FTPS for transmitting sensitive or private data. Configuring TCP ports depends on the protocol, as standard ports are associated with specific protocols (HTTP commonly uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443). While default protocol ports can be changed, doing so may complicate configuration and cause potential accessibility issues. However, many administrators choose to change standard default ports and a method to obscure them. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two principal transport methods. TCP is connection-oriented and provides reliability, ordering, and error-checking, making it suitable for applications requiring high levels of reliability. UDP is connectionless, making it faster than TCP and more suitable for real-time applications like video streaming, telephony, and gaming, where occasional packet loss is less impactful. When selecting secure protocols, administrators and analysts must consider suitable encryption levels, authentication methods, existing firewalls or other security equipment, and other factors which may impact the operation of the systems and software they are intended to protect. Ultimately, protocol selection requires an optimum balance among security, maintainability, performance, and cost.",
