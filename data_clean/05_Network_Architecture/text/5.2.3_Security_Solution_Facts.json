  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 This lesson covers the following topics: Security appliances Security solutions Security Appliances In network security, there are many appliances available to help secure your network. The size, needs, and resources of your organization will be factors in determining which ones to implement for your network. The following table includes several security appliances. Appliance\tDescription Proxy server A proxy server acts on behalf of a client or user when attempting to access resources over the internet. The proxy server, in this position of an intermediary, provides a layer of protection to the client. A proxy server works on a store-and-forward model. This means the proxy deconstructs each packet, performs analysis, then rebuilds the packet and forwards it on, if it conforms to the rules it’s been configured with. Client computers connect to a specified point on the perimeter network for web access. Traffic management Protection Anonymity for users by masking their IP addresses Caching engines Content filtering Content monitoring Incoming network traffic distribution across multiple servers to help balance the load Jump server\tA jump server is a hardened server that provides access to other hosts. Jump servers are often used for administrative tasks where administrators connect to the jump server first and then use it to access other internal systems, like servers or devices. A jump server is primarily used to enhance security by controlling access to sensitive resources. It acts as a gateway to access certain systems that are kept isolated from the external network. The jump server is typically locked down and secured to a higher degree, ensuring that only authorized users can access it, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems. Load balancer A load balancer, while primarily used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance, can also serve as a security appliance in certain scenarios. A load balancer distributes client requests across available server nodes in a farm or pool. This is used to provision services that can scale from light to heavy loads and to provide mitigation against denial-of-service attacks. A load balancer also provides fault tolerance. If there are multiple servers available in a farm all addressed by a single name/IP address via a load balancer, then if a single server fails, client requests can be forwarded to another server in the farm. A load balancer can be deployed in any situation where there are multiple servers providing the same function. Examples include web servers, front-end email servers, web conferencing, video conferencing, and streaming media servers. Layer 4 — A layer 4 load balancer makes forwarding decisions on IP address and TCP/UDP port values, working at the transport layer of the OSI model. Layer 7 — A layer 7 load balancer, or content switch, makes forwarding decisions based on application-level data, such as a request for a particular URL web address or data types like video or audio streaming, which requires more complex logic. Load balancers can also include a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that provides protection against common web application attacks. Modern load balancers often include features for traffic inspection and filtering. They can analyze incoming traffic for suspicious patterns, such as unusual request rates or malicious payloads. Traffic from potentially harmful sources can be dropped or redirected for further analysis. Sensor A packet sniffer is referred to as a sensor. Typically, the packet capture sensor is placed behind a firewall or close to a server of particular importance. The idea is to identify malicious traffic that has managed to get past the firewall. A single sniffer can record a large amount of traffic data so it's best to not put multiple sensors all over the network without provisioning the resources to manage them properly. Depending on network size and resources, one or only a few sensors are deployed to monitor key assets or network paths. The traffic captured by each sensor is transferred to a host or appliance running an intrusion detection system (IDS), such as Snort, Suricata, or Zeek. When traffic matches a detection signature, the IDS raises an alert or generates a log entry but does not block the source host. This type of passive sensor does not slow down traffic and is undetectable by the attacker. An IDS is used to identify and log hosts and applications and to detect password-guessing attempts, port scans, worms, backdoor applications, malformed packets or sessions, and other policy violations. All-in-one security appliance An all-in-one security appliance incorporates multiple security functions into a single piece of hardware. Unified Threat Management, or UTM, is the most common all-in-one appliance. UTM puts several key security components into a single device that's usually managed using a web interface. A manufacturer subscription for updates may also be required. Commonly implemented functionality of all-in-one-security devices include the following: URL filtering—prevents users from accessing URL restricted categories. Content inspection—helps ensure HTTP connections and content meet specified criteria. For example, many content filters actively monitor data streams by inspecting the packets in search of viruses, Trojans, worms, and other malicious code. Spam filtering—reduces junk mail in mailboxes of users. Firewall—can be configured with rules and used to log traffic to and from the network. Intrusion detection system—An IDS sends an alert if a network attack is detected. Intrusion prevention system—An IPS sends an alert if a network attack is detected or prevented. Switch Router Traffic shaping management Failure Modes A security device could enter a failure state for a number of reasons. There could be a power or hardware fault, an irreconcilable policy violation, or a configuration error. Hardware failure can be caused by power surges, overheating, and physical damage. Software failure can occur because of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and compatibility issues. Configuration issues can be caused by human errors such as inattention, fatigue, or lack of training. Finally, devices or sites might be impacted by natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Fail-open means that network or host access is preserved, if possible. This mode prioritizes availability over confidentiality and integrity. The risk of a fail-open control is that a threat actor could engineer a failure state to defeat the control. Fail-closed means that access is blocked or that the system enters the most secure state available, given whatever failure occurred. This mode prioritizes confidentiality and integrity over availability. The risk of a fail-closed control is system downtime. It may or may not be possible to configure the fail mode. For example, an inline security appliance that suffers power failure will fail-closed unless there is an alternative network path. Some devices designed to be installed inline have a backup cable path that will allow a fail-open operation. Content Filtering Server A content filtering server can deny or allow users access to certain websites. Content filtering servers typically have one or two configurations: Allow all content except for what you decide to ban Block all content except for what you decided to allow. These controls are implemented through security levels, allow lists, deny lists, and category levels. A content filter is designed to give network administrators and management the ability to block unwanted or inappropriate website browsing. For example, several organizations have guidelines stating that users can’t visit adult sites, gambling, or shopping sites while at work. A content filter can be put in place, and the network administrator can configure the filter to prevent users from visiting these types of sites. Most often, the content filter allows everything except sites and categories that are blocked via a deny list. For additional flexibility, security groups can be configured to allow or prevent site access by group. New websites are created every day, so the filters must be updated regularly, like virus definitions. Most content filtering servers have an online subscription service to update websites and website categories at certain intervals, usually daily or weekly. Web Filtering Web filtering plays a pivotal role in safeguarding an organization’s network. Its primary function is to block users from accessing malicious or inappropriate websites, thereby protecting the network from potential threats. Web filters analyze web traffic, often in real time, and can restrict access based on various criteria such as URL, IP address, content category, or even specific key words. Agent-based which is focused on filtering at each endpoint. Centralized filters from a centralized proxy server to which endpoints are connected. Agent-Based Filtering Agent-based web filtering involves installing a software agent on desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices. The agents enforce compliance with the organization's web filtering policies. Agents communicate with a centralized management server to retrieve filtering policies and rules and then apply them locally on the device. Agent-based solutions typically leverage cloud platforms to ensure they can communicate with devices regardless of the network they are connected to. This means filtering policies remain in effect even when users are off the corporate network, such as when working from home or traveling. Because filtering occurs locally on the device, agent-based methods often provide more granular control, such as filtering HTTPS traffic or applying different filtering rules for different applications. Agent-based filtering can also provide detailed reporting and analytics. Centralized Web Filtering In a centralized approach, a proxy server performs content filtering by analyzing web requests from users and determine whether to permit or deny access based on established policies. A centralized proxy server acts as an intermediary between end users and the internet. Beyond blocking unwanted or harmful content, a centralized proxy server can also perform detailed logging and reporting of web activity. A centralized proxy server employs various techniques to protect web traffic and ensure the safety of an organization’s network. Examples of these techniques include: URL scanning—involves blocking URLs known to host malicious content, are inappropriate, or violate the company’s policies. Content categorization—websites can be classified into various categories like social networking, gambling, webmail, and many others. Block rules—organizations can define rules to allow or deny access based on things like content categories, downloads of file types like .exe, or certain domains. Reputation-based filtering—leverages continually updated databases that score websites based on their observed behavior and history. Sites known for hosting malware, engaging in phishing attacks, or distributing spam, for instance, would have a poor reputation score and could be automatically blocked. Web Filtering Challenges Content and web filtering are not without potential issues and challenges. Three common challenges include: Overblocking which occurs when the filter is too restrictive, inadvertently blocking access to legitimate and useful websites and negatively impacting employee productivity. Underblocking which occurs when the filter allows access to potentially harmful or inappropriate websites. Handling of encrypted traffic like HTTPS. Without proper configuration, web filters may be unable to inspect encrypted traffic, representing most modern web traffic. DNS Filtering Domain Name System (DNS) filtering is a technique that blocks or allows access to specific websites by controlling the resolution of domain names into IP addresses. It operates on the principle that for a device to access a website, it must first resolve its domain name into its associated IP address, a process managed by DNS. When a request is made to resolve a website URI, the DNS filter checks the request against a database of domain names. If the domain is associated with malicious activities or is on an unapproved list for any reason, the filter blocks the request, preventing access to the potentially harmful website. It provides a proactive defense mechanism, blocking access to known phishing sites, malware distribution sites, and other malicious online destinations. It can help enforce an organization's acceptable use policies (AUPs) by blocking access to inappropriate or distracting websites and ensuring that the internet is used responsibly and productively. It can protect all devices connected to a network, including IoT devices, providing an extra layer of security. It is a simple solution that is easy to implement and presents minimal risk, making it a cost-effective security control suitable for networks of any size. While DNS filtering is highly effective, it must be combined with other security measures for comprehensive protection.
