This means that anyone with a wireless receiver can capture data from a network if it's not secured properly. In this lesson, we'll go over some common configuration problems and different cryptographic protocols we can implement to further secure our data. When we set up a new wireless access point, the first thing we need to do is properly configure it. Many users just plug it in and use the default settings, which is extremely dangerous. These settings are readily available for anyone to look up on the internet. The first setting to change is the default login information. All access points are shipped with a default login, such as admin. No other setting matters more than this one because if an attacker has our login information, they basically have complete control of the whole device. The next setting we should change is the network name, or SSID, which stands for service set identifier. The SSID can be a maximum of 32 bytes in length. We want to make sure that our SSID is unique to ourselves, but it shouldn't include identifiable information such as last name or address. By default, the SSID is broadcast, and anyone within range can see the network name. We can, though, disable this right from the start if we choose. This might seem like an obvious setting to enable, but it doesn't actually provide as much security as you'd think. A determined hacker can easily discover hidden SSIDs, and beyond that, disabling the SSID can cause connection issues for your device. You should experiment to see if disabling your SSID is the best option for your network. You can also configure your wireless access point to use MAC address filtering. This makes it so only hosts that have certain MAC addresses can connect, which helps you control which systems are allowed access in the first place. MAC address filtering provides a minimal level of security at best, though. It may discourage a casual attacker, but it won't stop a determined one. If an attacker is really set on gaining access to your wireless network, they can sniff packets and see which MAC addresses are being used to connect to the wireless access point. Then they can use MAC address spoofing to configure their system with one of the allowed MAC addresses. You should also monitor your wireless access point antenna placement and wireless access point antenna power levels. Data emanation is a significant security problem. By default, the radio signals used by a wireless network broadcast omni-directionally. That radio signal travels farther than you realize, which makes it possible for an attacker outside of your building to access your wireless network. You can limit this exposure by manipulating your wireless access point antenna placement and your wireless access point power levels to reduce the amount of data emanation outside of the building. Proper access point configuration is important to keeping a wireless network safe. But the most important security step is choosing the correct encryption method. Using a weak encryption method like WEP would make a network vulnerable to any hacker. When we configure our wireless network, it's important that we select the best cryptographic protocols available. For most users, the Wi-Fi Protected Access, or WPA, versions 2 or 3 are the best options. WPA2 was first introduced in 2004 and is still widely used today. There are two versions availableâ€”WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise. WPA2-Personal, also known as WPA2-PSK, or WPA2 pre-shared key, protects our network by using a pre-shared key referred to as the passphrase. WPA2-Enterprise verifies users through a RADIUS server. WPA2-Personal uses AES with CCMP to encrypt all data. This stands for Advanced Encryption Standard with Counter Mode Cypher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol. AES with CCMP uses a 128-bit key and encrypts data in 128-bit blocks. When a device connects to the access point, a four-way handshake occurs to authenticate the device. The pre-shared key and SSID are used to generate a session key during this process. A hacker can take advantage of some vulnerabilities in the four-way handshake to intercept the data and perform offline password attacks that could eventually crack weak passwords. To address these vulnerabilities and support new technologies, the WPA3 standard is being implemented. WPA3 was introduced in 2018. Instead of using a pre-shared key, WPA3 uses the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals standard, or SAE standard. SAE uses a 128-bit key and perfect forward secrecy to authenticate. Perfect forward secrecy is a cryptographic method that generates a new key for every transmission. This makes the handshake much more secure because if a hacker gets ahold of one message, they still aren't able to crack the keys. It'll take a while for WPA3 to fully replace WPA2 since WPA2 is currently implemented in many network devices. Until then, we need to be aware of the differences in these standards and their encryption method vulnerabilities so that we can better protect our networks. That'll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at some things we can do to better secure out wireless networks. We first looked at some of the default configurations we should change, including login information, the SSID, MAC address filtering, and transmission power. Then we looked at the two main cryptographic protocols in use today, which are WPA2 and WPA3. WPA2 is still the most widely used protocol, but WPA3 has been released and will eventually fix many of the vulnerabilities inherent in WPA2.",
