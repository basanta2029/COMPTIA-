  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script Let's talk about the Zero-Day Attack. A zero-day attack is a threat that exploits a vulnerability in a computer application that is still unknown, or that has never been exploited before. There are two primary vehicles used to conduct these types of attacks. The first one is a web browser. Browsers are popular targets because almost every system has one. The other type is sending zero-day exploits via email. A zero-day email contains a link that launches the attack if it's clicked. A zero-day attack occurs during the window between the time when the attacker first exploits the vulnerability and when the software developer creates a fix for it. This window may vary from a couple of days to many years. With this in mind, let's look at a process that many software developers use to prevent zero-day attacks. It is the Unknown Vulnerability Management Process The unknown vulnerability management process is a quality assurance process that finds and fixes unknown zero-day vulnerabilities. It is composed of four phases: analyze, test, report, and mitigate. During the Analyze phase, the developers are trying to find the application's vulnerabilities. They're looking for weaknesses and attack vectors, which are ways an attacker can get into the application. Here, the developers try to break the application themselves. Next is the Test phase. During this phase, what's called fuzz testing conducted against the attack vectors identified during the analysis phase. After testing comes the Report phase. During the report phase, personnel try to reproduce any issues found during the testing phase to make sure that the situation is replicable and represents a real vulnerability. Next is the Mitigate phase. This is where a fix is developed for the vulnerability, based on the results of the testing and reporting phases. What should Security Administrators do to defend against zero-day attacks? First is to configure automatic updates for the operating system and the application. By configuring automatic updates to the operating system, you are patching holes in the operating system where the application is running. The zero-day attacker is going to be looking for an exploit unique to that application. However, you want to close as many attack vectors as you can. Keeping your operating system updated will make your system safer from attacks in general. You should also have a network firewall and a host firewall. By using a host-based firewall, you're hardening the system where the application is running, making it more difficult for an exploit to take place. Finally, you should use an IDS or an IPS. For zero-day attacks, you are looking for anomalies. Consequently, virus scanners or malware detection applications probably won't work because they're based on signatures. There won't be a signature for an unknown exploit, and the attack will slip by your malware detection software. By using an intrusion detection system or an intrusion prevention system, you look for anomalies against the norm. The IDS system will alert you that there is something unusual going on with the system. You can then begin troubleshooting, and you may discover a potential zero-day attack occurring. In this video, we covered the basics of zero-day attacks and what they are. Then we looked at the methodology and procedures that software developers use to find the unknown vulnerabilities. Finally, we looked at a few things that you can do on your end to defend against zero-day attacks.",
