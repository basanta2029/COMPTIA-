In this lesson, we'll discuss version control management as well as provisioning and deprovisioning, which aid in protecting the source code. In application development, there's usually a complex process of writing, revising, and updating the code since multiple developers work together on the same project. There are different ways to approach this reality as this creates a challenge when keeping track of changes in the code. In general, most organizations use a version control system, or VCS, to track these changes. Let's look at how it works. A version control system uses a repository, which is a storage location that holds all the source files used during development. This centralized file system can be accessed by all authorized users. It allows developers to simultaneously work on the same file, revert to older files, and even restore files that were deleted. These repositories are often stored in the cloud or on a third-party website. There are many benefits to using a VCS. For one, it has the flexibility to allow for branching and merging. This allows a developer to work on one specific feature in a branch that he or she created, and then merge it back into the source code when ready. It also keeps a history of code changes. This history includes the details of who, what, when, and why. Together with annotations that developers can add, a team can understand why the code was designed the way it was. This also helps prevent incompatibility issues without preventing the developers from continuing their work. Now let's talk about provisioning. Provisioning is the process of giving access to users through privileges and permissions. It's important that developers and others working on a project have access to all the resources they need to do their work. This includes the permissions that you give in the VCS as well as in other areas of your system. It's important to only give permissions for specifically what a user needs and only until he or she no longer needs that access. If he or she moves on to another project, changes roles, leaves the organization, or if the project is complete, be sure to deprovision them. This means that you remove their privileges and permissions. This is the basic idea behind the principle of least privilege, which is important in application development just as it is throughout your organization. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed important secure coding techniques that include using a version control system to provide continuity, traceability, and protection throughout the development process. We then went over provisioning and deprovisioning as they apply to protecting the source code.",
