In 2011, Sony was targeted by an SQL injection attack that compromised over a million emails, usernames, and passwords. In 2013, the United Stated Department of Energy was targeted, and at least 100,000 employee records were compromised. These records included contact information, social security numbers, and even bank account numbers. Perhaps the most ironic attack occurred when mysql.com was attacked, releasing a large list of usernames and passwords to hackers. In each of these instances, the vulnerability wasn't in the SQL software, but in the way the websites and applications were implemented. Each of these attacks could have been prevented with careful front-end configuration and penetration testing. Because the SQL injection attacks target web applications, let's review how they work. When a user connects to a web application, they make a request through the browser. This request travels over the internet and to the web server. The web server accepts the request and sends it to the corresponding web app. The web application accesses the database, completes the requested task, and then responds to the web server. Once the transaction is complete, the web server sends the requested information to the user's browser. Because attackers are seeking information stored in the database, we also need to review how those work. Databases store all sorts of information, including application data, configuration data, customer data, login information, and--well--the possibilities are endless, so you can imagine why databases are valuable targets. A database is typically described by the way it stores data. A relational database can be organized in different ways, depending on need. For example, customer orders can be sorted by customer number, zip code, or product number. A distributed database is designed so it's easy to replicate to various locations across a network. An object-oriented database is designed around object classes and sub-classes. Inside these databases are various methods used to organize, manage, and retrieve data. Records and rows are used to represent a collection of relative data, such as information about a product, a user, or a customer. Think about the times you've gone shopping online, and you've sorted your selection by color, cost, or rating. These filters are possible because of these databases. When you think about the number of times you've entered contact information, account information, or other personal information, you can start to understand how valuable these stores of data are. SQL was specifically designed to request data from a database. These requests take the form of a query--a question--that asks the database to provide information specific to your request. It's important to note that SQL injections are a result of flaws in web applications, not in the database or the web server. These attacks exploit non-validated input vulnerabilities and use them to send SQL commands through the web application and to the database. This is done by injecting a code into an existing line of code before sending it onto the database for execution. If the injection is successful, the malicious code runs on the backend database and returns the requested information. So, how does an SQL injection work? Let's start with a very basic example. Let's say you're logging into your account. Normally, the user will enter their username-bobsmith--and their password-secret--into the appropriate spaces. Once they click Submit, the web application will send a string to the web server that contains the credentials. The command tells the database to check for the provided username and compare it to the stored password before granting access. Assuming that the user is found, they're directed to the requested page. As you can see, the data that the user entered is put into the same query as the commands. As a result, this code is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. If the login fields haven't been restricted, an attacker can add anything they want to them. Let's say the attacker knows that Bob's username is bobsmith, but they don't know Bob's password. They may be able to enter 'bobsmith'--'in the username field. The single quote indicates that data has ended and a command is beginning. The double dashes indicate that code is ending and a comment is being entered. Comments are code that a program doesn't execute--they usually contain explanations or reminders for the programmer. Because of this, the application knows to ignore the comments. Now, because the command treats everything after the dashes as comments, the instruction to verify the username with a given password is no longer visible, and the user is granted access to the user account. Although it's fairly easy to detect the initial vulnerabilities for this attack, SQL injections are extremely complex. They require a lot of patience and a high level of database and coding expertise. So, why would attackers go to all this trouble? Well, with great effort comes great reward, and that's what these attackers are counting on. SQL injections can be used to implement several types of attacks. When an attacker attempts an authentication bypass, they log into an application with administrative privileges without having to give a valid username or password. An information disclosure attack provides an attacker with sensitive information from the database. An attacker can use a compromised data integrity attack to deface a web page or alter a database's contents. Attackers can use an SQL injection attack to compromise data's availability; in other words, they can use it to delete information stored in the database. Attackers can also use this type of attack to remotely execute code and compromise the host operating system. Well, that's all for this lesson. We talked about SQL injections and how they relate to web application and database technologies.",
