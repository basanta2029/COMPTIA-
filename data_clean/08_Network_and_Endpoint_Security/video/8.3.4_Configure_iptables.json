We aren't going to cover everything about iptables because that's a vast subject that goes way beyond the scope of this course, but we are going to introduce the topic. We know that a firewall is a part of a computer system, or network, that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communications to hosts. Let's start by talking about the filtering table. A filter table has three of what's know as chains. The input chain applies rules to packets coming into the system. The forward chain is for packets being routed through the system. And the output chain is for locally generated packets sent out from the system. Let's look at our iptables. I have a Linux system running here, and I want to open the terminal, or command line. I'll select it. My terminal application is right here. But if it wasn't listed, I could type 'terminal' in the Search box. iptables is almost always preinstalled on Linux systems. But if it is not, we can run a command to install or update it. If it is installed, running this command won't hurt anything, so let's go ahead and do that now. To install or update iptables, we have to run this as a root user, so we need to use the sudo command. So, let's type in 'sudo apt-get install iptables'. Linux prompts me for my password, so I'll type that in right here. We can see it tells us that iptables is already installed, and I have the latest version. We are good to go here. The first thing I want to do is see what's currently configured. Remember that Linux is case sensitive, so pay attention to that when you type in commands. I'm going to clear the screen by typing .clear.. Let's type in 'sudo iptables -L'. Notice that the policy is set to Accept for all three chains. Let's say our Linux system is getting a very large number of ping requests, so we decide to block echo requests. We can do this with iptables. Let's jump over to a Windows 10 workstation. I'm going to ping my Linux system just to be sure they can communicate. I know that the IP address for the Linux system is 192.168.0.7, so let's type 'ping 192.168.0.7' and press Enter. You can see I get a response. Now let's jump over to our Linux system and block pings. Okay, I'm back on the Linux system. I'm going to clear the screen again. To block pings, I need to enter the following command: 'sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP'. Remember that this is case sensitive. With this command, the -A tells it I want to add a rule, the -p specifies the protocol. There are a whole lot of switches you can use, but we only use a couple here. We also told iptables to drop the request. We also could have told it to reject the request. The difference is that if we drop it, the system responds as if there isn't even a system there. It does nothing except drop the request. Reject, on the other hand, responds with a message saying the destination port is unreachable. That might tell a hacker that there is something there, but it's not replying. Now let's go back to our Windows 10 workstation once more and try to ping again. I'm going to type .ping 192.168.0.7. and press Enter. You see that I get request timed out messages back, so the rule is working. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we talked about iptables. We ran the command to install and update iptables. We looked at the iptables default policies and then configured a simple rule to drop ping requests to our Linux system.",
