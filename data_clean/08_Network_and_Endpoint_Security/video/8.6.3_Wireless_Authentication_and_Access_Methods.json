But in order to authenticate users and distribute authentication keys, other methods are generally used. In this lesson, we'll go over some of the different access methods we can implement to connect to a wireless network as well as the authentication protocols we often find in enterprise environments. Depending on the environment, we can use different methods to connect users to a wireless network. Let's take a look at some of these methods. The first and probably most common access method is to use a pre-shared key, or PSK. A PSK is simply a passphrase that we type in to connect to a network. If we don't want to type in the passphrase to connect each and every device, we can use Wi-Fi Protected Setup, or WPS, to simplify the process. WPS only works with a network that uses a pre-shared key and WPA2. On the access point, there's usually a button that makes WPA2 start to search for devices in range. On the connecting device, there's probably a WPS button that automatically joins the device to the access point. You need to enter a unique eight-number access point pin if the connecting device doesn't have a button like this. Some devices and access points can also use Near Field Communication, or NFC, during the WPS process to connect to each other. Our other option is to simply have an open network. This means that no authentication takes place, and anyone can connect to the network at will. This should only be used by public establishments that want to offer free wireless access. Many open networks implement a captive portal. Captive portals force a user to view and interact with them before accessing the network. Basically, you're initially able connect your device to the wireless network. But before you can access the internet, you're redirected to a captive portal page. You might be prompted to agree to the network's terms and conditions or maybe even asked to pay a fee before you can proceed. These portals are used a great deal today, and you've most likely used one before. In an enterprise environment, using a PSK isn't very secure or efficient. Enterprise networks usually make use the 802.1x Protocol to authenticate users to the wireless network. 802.1x authentication is one of the most secure ways to enforce wireless network authentication. On a wired network, once a user is authenticated, the port they're connected to is activated. The port remains off if the user's activation fails. We can implement the 802.1x Protocol in a wireless network by enabling a virtual port when the user is authenticated. There are three components to an 802.1x setup. The first is the supplicant, or wireless client. Then we have the authenticator, which is responsible for handling the communications between the supplicant and the authentication server—the third component. Know that oftentimes, the authentication server is a RADIUS server. When you use a RADIUS server, the authenticator is also known as the network access server, or NAS. RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In Service. It was developed in 1991 and was originally used to authenticate users to remote networks over dial-up networks. We still use it today to remotely authenticate users. Obviously, though, we don't do this over dial-up connections anymore, which are more or less antiquated. RADIUS is known as a triple-A protocol, meaning that it provides authentication, authorization, and accounting management. When using 802.1x with RADIUS, the client sends their credentials to the authenticator, or NAS. The NAS forwards the credentials to the RADIUS server to verify. If you use a Windows server, this is done using Active Directory. Then the server sends back the verification and user rights to the NAS, which forwards them back to the client. Then the client can access network resources. Using 802.1x authentication significantly increases your wireless network security. To ensure that the authentication information being sent between these devices is secure, the Extensible Authentication Protocol, or EAP, is used. EAP isn't actually a specific protocol; it's merely a framework in which other protocols work. As a security administrator, you need to be familiar with several different EAP protocols. Let's start by looking at the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, or PEAP. PEAP was created collaboratively by Cisco, Microsoft, and RSA Security. This protocol encapsulates the authentication communications within a TLS tunnel and exclusively uses a server-side certificate to authenticate Wi-Fi clients. This simplifies network implementation and administration. Next, we have EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling, or EAP-FAST. EAP-FAST was created by Cisco, and it works by making a TLS tunnel that doesn't require an authentication server certificate. Instead, this protocol uses a Protected Access Credential, or PAC, to authenticate users. Then, we have EAP Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS is the original and probably most secure of the wireless EAP authentication protocols. Because it's the original, it's also the most widely supported. The nice thing about EAP-TLS is that it requires client-side certificates in addition to server-side certificates. The certificate fully encrypts the authentication handshake between client and server and is then used in place of a password, making it practically impossible to crack. But because each client requires an installed CA-signed PKI certificate, EAP-TLS is much more labor intensive and expensive to implement than other protocols. The final protocol is EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TTLS. EAP-TTLS is essentially an updated version of EAP-TLS. The biggest difference is that we only need a certificate on the server. This greatly simplifies the implementation process since we don't need a certificate on each wireless device. EAP-TTLS has been supported natively since Windows 8. By using the right authentication protocol, you can greatly increase your wireless network's security and further protect it from attacks. That'll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at the different wireless network access methods we can implement, including pre-shared keys, server authentication, and open networks. We also went over how WPS and captive portals work. Then we saw the various authentication methods that can be used for wireless networks. First, we looked at RADIUS and how it utilizes 802.1x authentication. We finished up by looking at the different EAP protocols, which include PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS.",
