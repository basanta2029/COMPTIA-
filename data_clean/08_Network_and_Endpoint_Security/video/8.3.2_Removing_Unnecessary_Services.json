For this demo, we're going to work with an Ubuntu Linux system and practice working with some services. I'm already logged on to the system, and I'll start the terminal. I have a shortcut here, but you can also go here, to Show Applications, and then search for 'terminal' in the search box. I want to see the init.d directory. We're interested in services that are running. Let's go to the directory by typing 'cd /etc/init.d/'. Press Enter. Now I'll do an 'ls' to see what's in this directory. All right, here are my services. Here, I have Apache server. Here, I have mysql. Over here, we have ssh. And down here, there's FTP. On this system, there's no reason to have FTP running, so let's see how we can stop it. I'll type 'cd' to get back to root and 'clear' to clean up my screen. So far, I've used init.d to view the services. To manage the services, I'm going to use the systemctl command. Using init.d scripts to manage services isn't possible on newer systems anymore, but I still use it to view services sometimes. Let's look at my FTP server. First, I want to see its status. So, let's type 'sudo systemctl status vsftpd' and press Enter. It says it's enabled, but it's currently stopped. I'm going to use my up arrow to get to the last command, change it from status to 'start', and press Enter. Now I'll arrow up until I see status and press Enter again. I can see that it's running along with some statistics, such as how long it's been up. I can also see the process ID, or PID, right here. Let's clear the screen. Now I'm going to use my up arrow to go back to my last command. I'm going to backspace here, get rid of the word \"start:\", and type in 'stop' to stop the FTP service. I'll arrow up again until I get to status and press Enter. Now you can see that the process has stopped. I'll press Ctrl+C to exit this command and then type 'clear'. Now I might say, oops, that's not what I wanted to do! It's okay. We'll just arrow up again until we get to start. Press Enter, and everything's just fine again. What if I made changes to my FTP server, and I need to restart the service? I can just do a restart. Let's up arrow to the last command, backspace here, type in 'restart', and press Enter. Arrow up to the last command, backspace, and change this to 'status'. Press Enter, and you can see my service restarted. I'll clear the screen again. So far, we've stopped and started our FTP service. But what if I want to have it start at system startup? Or, perhaps, not start when the system starts up? First, let's see if the service is enabled or not. I can do that with the is-enabled command. I'll arrow up to the last command and change this part to 'is-enabled'. Press Enter, and right here, it says that it's enabled. What if you want to have your service start every time your system starts? You can do that by changing this to 'enable' and pressing Enter. Now you can see the status is enabled. If I don't want the service to start, I'll arrow up and change this to 'disable'. Press Enter, and that'll tell this system not to start FTP at startup. I'll arrow up and change this to 'status', and you can see that, up here, it says \"disabled\", so when the system boots, FTP won't start. Note that the service is still running at the moment because all we did was keep it from running at startup; we didn't stop it from running at this moment. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we worked with system services. First, we viewed the services to see what was on our system. Then we practiced stopping, starting, enabling, and disabling services.",
