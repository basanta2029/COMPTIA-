Although XSS attacks can exploit various web technologies like HTML and Flash, JavaScript is one of their primary vehicles. Consequently, we'll focus on how to disable JavaScript in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Before we delve deeper into this demo, please be aware that you can indeed prevent cross-site scripting attacks by disabling JavaScript in web browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. However, it's crucial to understand that disabling JavaScript can significantly impact the functionality and user experience of many websites. Please consider this trade-off carefully before implementing such restrictions. Let's begin with Microsoft Edge. I've already opened Edge, and now we'll navigate to the settings. Click on the three dots, also known as the ellipsis, and select Settings. In the settings menu, go to Cookies and site permissions. You'll find a list of items on the right. Scroll down until you locate JavaScript. Here, you can toggle off the switch next to Allowed (recommended) to disable JavaScript. In some versions of Edge, you might receive a confirmation dialog; if so, click Turn off to confirm the action. JavaScript is now disabled in Microsoft Edge. To enable it again, simply follow the same steps and toggle the switch back on. Let's switch to Google Chrome and see how to disable JavaScript there. Click on the three dots in the top right corner, then select Settings. Navigate to Privacy and security and click on Site settings. Scroll down until you find JavaScript, and click on it. Choose the radio button that says, Don't allow sites to use JavaScript to disable it. To enable JavaScript, simply select Sites can use JavaScript to turn it back on. It's also essential to mention the potential risks associated with the browser's credential autofill feature. This feature is often enabled by default in most commonly used browsers. To disable the ability to save passwords, go to Autofill and passwords and click on it. If you use Google Password Manager, you can toggle off Google's offer to save passwords and the ability to sign in automatically. Remember that these settings can be adjusted as needed. In summary, the most effective prevention of cross-site scripting is typically implemented in the design of web applications. However, as a user, you may not always know if the sites you visit have taken all necessary precautions to protect against XSS attacks. Therefore, being able to disable JavaScript in your browser can provide an additional layer of security when needed. Just remember to weigh the potential loss of website functionality against the security benefits when deciding to disable JavaScript.",
