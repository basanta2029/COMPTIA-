  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script In this demonstration, we're going to go through some of the steps you can take to harden a wireless network, and we're going to use a wireless controller. This means we make changes on the controller itself, and those changes propagate out to each of the access points connected to it. The concepts in this demo transfer to other types of wireless access points, such as all-in-one small office/home office devices. To start, we need to log in to our controller. I have a web browser open, and I've entered the controller's IP address. I'll enter the username, ‘admin', and password, and we're logged in. The first thing we want to do is change the default username and password for this device. This is the first thing you should do with any networking device you're configuring. It's very important that you change those defaults. We do this on the Administer tab. Notice we can also choose to use an authorization server if we want to, but just change the default username to something else. We'll enter the old password and then the new password. Click Apply. The Admin session timeout setting is also on this page. This setting defines how much time must pass before the user is automatically logged out. This is a nice thing to have, as it keeps users from logging in to the device and then walking away from it and leaving it vulnerable. Let's change this to 10 minutes. Click Apply. Now we're asked to log out and start a new session with the new timeout setting. Click OK, and let's log in with our new username and password. Let's go to the Configure tab. There are a lot of settings and options on this tab. On the System tab, we can specify the IP address and subnet mask to use on the network. It's good to change this from a typical IP address range, as it adds another layer of security, but we'll leave it how it is for now. Let's go to the Access Points page. On this page, we can see all the access points connected to the wireless controller. Right now, we only have one AP, or access point, connected. If we wanted to, we could click Edit and change the configuration. Notice that all these options require us to override the group configuration. Remember, this is a wireless controller. As such, it controls the configuration options for each access point in the network. If we want to change the settings on a specific access point (for example, change the channel it's using), we can do that here. For now, let's click Cancel. Under Access Point Groups, any changes to this configuration will be applied to all the APs in the network. This makes managing networks with multiple APs very easy. All the settings look good, so let's just click Cancel. On the WLANs page, we can create wireless LANs--that is, we can create multiple wireless networks, each specified by an SSID. For example, we currently have three different WLANs configured on this controller. Let's edit the DevRuckusAP network. Here, we can see the configuration of this network and that it's defined as a standard network. We can also configure the authentication options. Right now, the authenticate type is open. We could configure this to connect to a RADIUS server, specify that it use MAC address authentication, or use a combination of the two. We can also configure the encryption method. We're using WPA2 with the AES algorithm. You can see we have a very weak passphrase configured, which is fine for a demo, but make sure you use a complex passphrase with this encryption. Down here, we can also configure the WLAN to use a captive portal. The Wireless Client Isolation option allows us to configure the network to isolate each connected client. There are also a lot of advanced options we won't get into, but remember there's a lot of customization that can happen with these types of wireless controllers that you just can't find in smaller, consumer-grade devices. Leave everything as it is and click Cancel. Let's look at the configuration of the Guest network. Notice the type is defined as Guest, which causes our guest access policies and access control settings to be applied. We also need to note that we're using open authentication with no encryption. This is an open, unsecure guest network. That's why we're isolating wireless client traffic from each other. It's good idea to have this option enabled on guest networks. Click Cancel, and let's go to the Access Control page. On this page, we can configure how client access is controlled. For example, under L2-L7 Access Control, we can define MAC address control lists that can be used with a specific WLAN. To define MAC address control lists, add all the MAC addresses you want to give network access to and then enable MAC address filtering on the specific WLAN to use that list. We can also do this by IP address. Under Device Access Policy, we can permit or deny clients based on their device specifications. For example, we could deny all clients using a particular operating system. Application Recognition and Filtering is another useful feature. It lets us block traffic based on port, IP address, protocol, and other characteristics. We configure this by looking at our access points' logs and identifying the different types of traffic. We would then take that information and decide if we want to block anything. Let's go back up to the device access policy and define a rule. We're going to create a rule that blocks traffic from video game consoles. We'll name the rule and add a description. Click Create New. Notice, under OS/Type, that we have an option for gaming. This identifies traffic generated by video game consoles, such as an Xbox or PlayStation console. We want to deny this traffic, so we'll select Deny from the rule type dropdown. Click Save > OK. There's a number of other features on this controller that you can use. We can add roles and policies that affect users, and we can add users to the device. We can also configure the controller to notify us of specific events via email. On the Services page, we can configure self-healing and background scanning, which are both very useful feature, but they're outside the scope of this video. We can also configure wireless intrusion detection. Wireless intrusion detection and prevention system (WIPS) is, actually, a very useful feature. It helps protect against wireless attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rogue access points, evil twin attacks, and rogue DHCP servers. For example, we can protect against repeated authentication attacks right here. We can even specify how long a client will be blocked. This helps protect our system from DoS attacks and brute force attacks. We can also configure the controller to automatically flag APs trying to spoof an SSID or MAC address as a malicious device. This is a great tool for protecting against evil twin attacks. That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we discussed some of the things you can do to harden a wireless network using a wireless network controller.",
