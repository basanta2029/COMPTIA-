Oftentimes, these applications have access to critical components of the operating system. Attackers will target application vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges, crash the system, access the network, steal sensitive data, and more. In this lesson, we'll look at some of the common vulnerabilities and attacks you need to be aware of and some steps you can take to mitigate them. When an attacker gains access to a system, one of their first goals is to gain enough privileges to execute their own code on the target system, known as arbitrary code execution. There are two types of privilege escalation. The first is horizontal escalation, which happens when the attacker accesses functionality or data that belongs to another user with the same privilege level they currently have, such as a co-worker. This type of escalation is usually only focused on gaining access to that particular account. Vertical escalation is the more common escalation type. It occurs when the attacker gains access to an account with a higher-level access than they currently have, such as an administrator account. Vigilant monitoring and proper implementation of access control security measures, such as strong passwords and implementing the principle of least privilege, will go a long way in protecting against escalation attacks. Now, let's look at memory injection attacks. These attacks occur when the attacker injects malicious code into a running application's process memory. One of the more common types is an overflow attack. An overflow occurs when a program is designed only to handle a certain amount of data, but the attacker sends more data, which can cause the system to crash or behave in unexpected ways. The most common of these is the buffer stack overflow, which targets the stack of a program. To better understand this, let's look at how programs are put together. Overflow attacks are one of the most dangerous types of attacks. The main cause of these attacks is errors in programming. The best way to defend against these attacks is to use proper programming practices and avoid programming functions known to be vulnerable. Thankfully, many modern languages, such as Python and Java, have built-in controls to prevent overflow attacks. A replay attack, also known as a session replay or session hijack, exploits the session cookies that are generated when you connect to a web application. These cookies allow the application to identify the user and prove that they've been authenticated. The hacker can intercept the cookie using an on-path attack and then forge their own cookie file to establish a session with the web application. This allows the attacker to gain access to the victim's account without knowing their credentials. To prevent this form of attack, use a strong digital signature with timestamps, session keys that are time-bound and process-bound, and sequence numbers. Authentication systems can be programmed to accept network packets with valid timestamps and sequence numbers. The last attack we'll look at is the malicious update. This occurs when a software program update seems legitimate but contains malicious code. This can happen when the software's website is hacked, and the update file is replaced with the malicious one. This type of attack is particularly devastating because it not only harms the victims but can also destroy the reputation of the software developer. Malicious updates can be difficult to protect against, but secure software supply chain management, digital signature verification, and other software security practices help mitigate these risks. That'll wrap up this lesson on web application attacks. In this lesson, we reviewed some common attacks you should be aware of, including escalation attacks, memory injection attacks, replay attacks, race conditions, and malicious updates. We also looked at some security measures we can take to help mitigate each of these attacks.",
