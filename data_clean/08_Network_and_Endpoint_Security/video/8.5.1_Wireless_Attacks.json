This includes all types of wireless networks, as in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, and even NFC. In this lesson, I'm going to go over the various attacks that threaten wireless networks. Because network security is a top priority, it's common for network administrators to implement stringent rules and limit website access. Some users find this very frustrating. To try to evade these rules, users sometimes install an access point on their own computer. This is known as a soft access point. A network hacker who has gained access to a network, perhaps using MAC spoofing, might do the same. This is called a rogue access point or an unauthorized association. Here's the big problem—most employees don't understand the importance of securing their soft access point or even how to do it. So they just leave it open to hackers. When an attacker discovers an access point, they're able to run various types of vulnerability scanners from outside the company, perhaps from a car or adjacent building or even from several miles away. Keep in mind that if a hacker can gain some type of physical access to your company, they can also hide a physical rogue access point as well. This is often done by configuring an extremely compact and powerful hardware device called a Raspberry Pi as their access point. A rogue access point that's placed on the network by a malicious attacker can be used to run what's called an evil twin attack. Here's how this works—say your organization currently has a wireless network with a SSID of MyCompanyWiFi. The attacker configures their own access point with the same SSID and places it near the organization's building. Then the attacker uses a jamming or disassociation attack to knock users off the legitimate network. When users reconnect to the network, they're now connecting to the attacker's access point instead. Once a victim is connected to a rogue access point, the attacker can capture all data flowing through it. The user shouldn't notice anything different since their internet is still running like normal. These attacks are extremely dangerous as the attacker gains immediate access to all sorts of sensitive information. To defend against these attacks, you should perform regular site surveys to locate any rogue access points. Your wireless networks encrypt data, which helps protect against sniffing. But some older standards, like WEP, are vulnerable due to improperly configured initialization vectors, or IVs. When we encrypt data, we use a secret key that only we know. If we use the same key for everything we encrypt, it won't take long for the key to be compromised. This is where initialization vectors can help out. The IV is a random string that's added to the key to create a different key for each encryption process. Unfortunately, if we don't configure the IV properly, it can open us up to attacks. Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP, was one of the first wireless security protocols that used IVs to help with encryption. The problem, though, was the IV was only 24 bits long and the key was 40 bits. This meant there was only approximately 16 million different IVs that could be generated. This may sound like a lot, but it actually meant that an IV would be repeated at least once every 4096 packets. It doesn't take much time to get 4096 packets, and attackers were able to develop programs that would flood the network with packets to find matching IVs. Once an attacker gets multiple IVs, they can begin decrypting the encryption key. After that, all communication is open and no longer secure. No networks should use WEP anymore. Newer wireless standards such as WPA-2 don't even use IVs for encryption. For many of these wireless attacks to work, the attacker needs to kick everyone off the legitimate network and prevent them from reconnecting. They attempt this with jamming attacks or disassociation attacks. A Wi-Fi jamming attack requires a special device that works by analyzing the spectrum used by wireless networks and then transmitting a powerful signal on the same frequencies. Basically, the jammer tries to be the loudest voice in the room so nearby devices can't see the legitimate wireless network. The hope is that they disconnect and are unable to reconnect again. Jamming devices are illegal and difficult to come by, though. A disassociation attack, on the other hand, can be performed with a laptop. This is also know as a deauthentication attack. When a device connects to a wireless network, special unencrypted management packets are sent back and forth. A deauthentication attack takes advantage of this unencrypted process by sending fake, malicious deauthentication packets to kick people off the network. The attacker can select individual users or kick everyone off at once. Jamming and deauthentication attacks have the same end result, but they use very different methods. Wi-Fi is used everywhere today and attackers are always working on methods to exploit weaknesses. Yet another wireless technology that can be susceptible to attacks is Bluetooth. From headphones and speakers to watches, fitness devices, automobiles, and even refrigerators, Bluetooth devices are heavily integrated into our daily lives. This makes these devices attractive to malicious attackers. An attacker can gather all sorts of personal data and even take over our devices' embedded cameras and microphones. One common Bluetooth attack is Bluejacking. When performing a Bluejacking attack, he or she looks for another Bluetooth device that's discoverable and sends unwanted messages to it. Attackers can't gain control of a device or steal any data so Bluejacking is more annoying than harmful. Bluesnarfing, on the other hand, can be harmful. Bluesnarfing is when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the OBject EXchange Protocol, or OBEX Protocol, to pair to a target device. Once paired, he or she is able to access all the victim's device data and then disconnect without leaving a trace. The best defense against both of these attacks is to only enable Bluetooth when you need to and to not leave devices in Discovery Mode. Radio frequency identification, or RFID, uses radio waves to transmit data from small circuit boards called RFID tags to special scanners. Active RFID tags, like those seen in a car's toll pass, have on-board batteries and can send signals over a long distance. Passive RFID tags, which are used in ID badges and credit cards, aren't powered. These tags instead rely on the RFID scanner's transferred energy. A malicious attacker can build their own scanner to target these RFID tags. If an attacker can get close enough, they can scan the RFID chip and clone it. An attacker might also eavesdrop on the communication between the chip and reader and steal the data that way. To protect against these attacks, RFID chips often operate at different frequencies, making it more difficult for an attacker to quickly complete a scan. Also, because most of these chips are passive, an attacker has to get extremely close for it to work. Near field communication, or NFC, is a newer technology that's built on RFID. NFC allows two-way communication between two devices. But they must be within a few centimeters of each other. NFC is what allows us to use our smartphones to pay for items at the store. We can also use NFC to transfer files between two phones if they're right next to each other. NFC is vulnerable to the same types of attacks as RFID, but it requires the attacker to be incredibly close. That'll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at some different wireless communications attacks. We first looked at Wi-Fi and rogue access points, evil twin attacks, how an IV can be exploited, and also how jamming and disassociation attacks work. Then we looked at Bluetooth attacks, including Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing. Finally, we covered how RFID and NFC work and the security concerns associated with both of these devices.",
