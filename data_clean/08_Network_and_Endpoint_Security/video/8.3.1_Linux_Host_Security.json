Just like its Windows counterpart, though, Linux is vulnerable to attacks. By default, the Linux OS is designed to reduce vulnerability and attack surface, but attackers are still able to exploit known vulnerabilities. There's only one way to eliminate all potential threats and that's to disconnect from the internet. Unfortunately, this isn't an option for most users. With that in mind, you should remain vigilant and take the necessary precautions to protect your system. In this lesson, we'll discuss how to minimize your Linux system's attack surface with simple yet effective methods for reducing the chances of an attack. The first step is to lessen your system's attack surface as a whole. The more services that are loaded and active on a system, the more opportunities exist for attack. Many services utilize a specific TCP/IP port that's exposed to the network. Services such as DNS, FTP, SNMP, and others may or may not be required on your system. If not, these services should be unloaded and deactivated. Different Linux distributions load various programs and daemons, and certain programs and daemons are necessary dependencies of others. So make sure you understand your system's requirements before you attempt to unload and deactivate anything. To see a list of all loaded and active services, you can use the ‘systemctl' command, as shown here. When used, both the service name and description are displayed. Additionally, you can add the ‘list-dependencies' statement to display a dependency services tree. With this information, you can discover potentially unneeded services and unload them. You first stop the service and then disable it from starting automatically. A word of caution—do your research! Don't simply unload a service without knowing what it's used for. It may be a system service or a service that something else depends on. Look up the name in a search engine, or use the ‘man' or ‘info' utilities to find out what it's used for. Only then, if you determine it's unneeded, should you stop and disable the service. It may be necessary to have ports open for a Linux system to work properly. For example, if a server provides DHCP or DNS services or web content, TCP/IP ports must be open to allow everything to work. One way to discover open ports on a system is to use the Nmap utility. Nmap is a tool that's either bundled with Linux distributions or can be installed using apt or yum. When used appropriately, this tool can provide you with very useful information about a given system or network. When used inappropriately, attackers can take control and perform reconnaissance. For our purposes, we can use Nmap to show us our system's open ports. Often, open ports are indications that a service is running on the system that controls that port. If we see a port open that shouldn't be, it can tell us that a service is running on the system that we probably don't need. We can check the system and stop and disable the service if needed. In the example here, Nmap shows the default gateway's open ports. There may be ports we expect and others we don't. For example, here we see that port 80 is open with the service http. If this machine doesn't require web services, we may want to close that port by stopping the web server. If we see an unexpected open port, we need to find the service that's opening that port to determine whether the service is necessary or not. If it isn't, we can stop and disable the service to close the port. Just use this tool with caution. Since Nmap is widely used by hackers, running it may trigger alarms and alerts. There are many command line parameters available with Nmap that let us customize the desired command output. Let's discuss a few. The ‘–sU' and ‘–sT' parameters display only UDP and TCP ports. Keep in mind that these parameters might make your scan take an extraordinarily long time. Use ‘-6' to choose IPv6 scanning. To enable OS detection, use ‘-A' or ‘–O'. We use the ‘-p' parameter to specify a range, while the ‘-sn' parameter enables a ping-only scan to determine if a host is up without having to perform a port scan. Netstat is another Linux or Windows tool that we can use to scan for open ports. In this example, a Linux machine was used to display open ports on a system with IPv4. I used the ‘–l' option to view a list of listening sockets and the ‘4' option to show only IPv4 addresses on the Linux host. Here you see I have a socket open for ssh. Also, the system is running NTP. These are TCP/IP ports that are well known as ports 22 and 123, respectively. By using this output, I can also see what else is running on the system. We can customize the Netstat utility to provide us with only the information we're specifically looking for. As with Nmap, the Netstat utility has several command line parameters. For example: ‘-a' lists all listening and non-listening sockets. ‘-I' displays statistics for all your network interfaces. ‘-l' displays just listening sockets or sockets that are open for listening. ‘-s' displays summary information for each protocol enabled on the system. ‘-r' shows your routing table. Keep in mind that these options may vary in availability depending on whether we're using the Linux version of Netstat or the Windows version. In addition to unloading unneeded services, you also need to make sure that your Linux operating system remains current by installing operating system and program updates. For example, as software is released, it's usually not perfect and free of defects. Defects can take the form of logic errors in which a program doesn't calculate or apply input correctly. There could be something wrong with a screen display as well. In addition, vulnerabilities can be introduced that would allow threat actors to compromise your system. Often, these defects are found only after software has been released. So once the software is in use and the defects are found and corrected, it's important that you update your software immediately. You can manually update the packages on your system using package managers such as yum or apt. The one you use will depend on which distribution you're using. These processes scour the repository and search for newer updates and patches. If a single package requires an update, the package name can be specified to check if that package requires an update. Most often, though, it's a good practice to update all available package updates. For example, if you're running a Red Hat variant, such as CentOS or Fedora, run the ‘yum update' command, as shown here. In this example, you see that only a single package—libexif—needs an update. When you use a Debian variant like Ubuntu or Mint, you first run the ‘apt update' command. This refreshes the repository information. After that, you run ‘apt upgrade' to perform the manual update process. Notice that in this case, there are 28 packages to be upgraded. An exception to utilizing apt or yum is with SuSE Linux. SuSE Linux uses a different package manager called zypper. The syntax for the command is similar to apt and yum and accomplishes the same tasks. The last topic for enabling Linux host security is to ensure a host-based firewall is running on your Linux system. One philosophy of computer security is to utilize a layered approach. Most systems are protected first by a network firewall. If anything does happen to get through, threat actors also have to contend with the host system's firewall as well. Most, if not all, Linux systems are distributed with host-firewall software. This software is known as firewalld. In some instances, there might even be a series of firewalls that are specific to protecting certain network aspects. These together form a solid barrier to attackers. But nothing is foolproof and adding another layer of protection is always a good idea. The Linux host-based firewall adds additional protection from outside entities, and it can also protect the system from insider threats, too. A host-based firewall acts like a gatekeeper between your system and the external and internal network. This firewall monitors all traffic that flows in both directions between the computer and network. You configure this firewall with a list of rules called access control lists, or ACLs. These rules define what is and isn't allowed to pass through. Several Linux distributions use the firewalld daemon to implement host-based firewalls. Other distributions might use a different package, so check your distribution vendor to see which one to use. First, make sure firewalld has been installed on your system. You can use the ‘yum' or ‘apt' command lines to check whether it has, as shown here. If those commands return a value, you know firewalld has been installed and you can begin configuring it. If you get a blank message or one stating firewalld could not be found, you'll need to download and install it. This can also be done using the ‘yum' or ‘apt' commands. Know that firewalld depends on the Python programming language. If not already installed, just note that the installer will also install the needed Python dependencies on your system. If firewalld is already installed or if you just installed it, you need to ensure it's running and active with the ‘systemctl' command shown here. It might not be running, and you might see inactive or dead as the status. If that's the case, you can start the daemon by issuing the ‘systemctl start firewalld' command. Checking the status again should show the daemon running. With the firewall running, there are several different commands that you can use to manage it. We use the ‘firewall-cmd' command and add parameters to control how the firewall operates and is configured. A sampling of the commands are listed here. Run the ‘firewall-cmd --state' command to check the firewall's status. You can also run ‘firewall-cmd --get-active-zones' to display the default firewall zone configuration. This particular firewall package comes with several predefined firewall zones that you can use, starting at extremely secure to not very secure at all. Predefined zones include Home, External, Work, and Trusted. The default zone most distributions predefine is Public, but you can actually pick whichever one you want to use. Once you have the firewall running and a default zone set up, there may be situations in which you need to open a particular firewall port to support a particular service. For example, if the system is set up as a web server, you must let web traffic through. If you don't configure firewall exceptions, the web traffic will be blocked. Web servers typically use ports 80 and 443 or HTTP and HTTPS for web traffic. We need to allow these ports to remain open so that the web server is reachable. To do this, we need to allow the right ports and protocols through the firewall. To enable web services, we open ports on the firewall. To open ports, we add them to the exception list on the firewall itself. This is also done using the ‘firewall-cmd' command. For example, we first use the ‘--permanent' parameter to store the exception in the database so that it remains persistent even if the computer is restarted. Next, we need to define which zone we're using and then the port we want open. It's also possible to use the protocol rather than the port number when placing exceptions into the firewall. We place the exception in the firewalld configuration with HTTPS by using the same command but substituting the protocol. The last thing we need to do is restart the firewall or reload the configuration. If the system is in use and we don't want to disrupt it, we enter the ‘reload' command, which allows the firewall daemon to continue running. The new configuration is loaded and activated for us in the background. The last thing we need to do is restart or reload the newly configured firewall. This allows us to use these changes immediately without rebooting the system. The ‘reload' parameter leaves the firewall activated. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed some procedures to keep a Linux host safer from attacks. We discussed removing unneeded services from your system and using Nmap and Netstat to identify running services. We also discussed how keeping the system current with OS and program updates is important. Finally, we ended by discussing the benefits of implementing the host-based firewall called firewalld.",

We place the exception in the firewalld configuration with HTTPS by using the same command but substituting the protocol. The last thing we need to do is restart the firewall or reload the configuration. If the system is in use and we don't want to disrupt it, we enter the ‘reload' command, which allows the firewall daemon to continue running. The new configuration is loaded and activated for us in the background. The last thing we need to do is restart or reload the newly configured firewall. This allows us to use these changes immediately without rebooting the system. The ‘reload' parameter leaves the firewall activated.",
      "summary": "The \"Manage Firewalld\" section of the CompTIA Security+ course covers the essential commands for configuring and managing the firewalld service, primarily using the 'firewall-cmd' command. Key topics include checking the firewall's status, managing predefined zones (such as Home, External, and Public), and opening specific ports to allow traffic for services like web servers. Practical applications involve setting persistent exceptions for ports and protocols, reloading configurations without disrupting active services, and ensuring that the firewall effectively protects the system while enabling necessary communications.",
