We're going to focus on LDAP, XML, and command injection attacks and a variation called the directory traversal attack. A lightweight directory access protocol, or LDAP, injection attack is used to exploit a web-based application. If the application fails to properly validate the input in the form fields, then it's possible for the wrong commands to be constructed. This could potentially provide an attacker with unauthorized access to the LDAP directory tree. They may be able to view more information than they should have access to, or even modify it. Suppose we have an application that uses LDAP calls to communicate with the directory tree. Client workstations can access the web server, load the application's web page, and query the directory services tree. Here, if the user supplies an invalid value, or a malicious value, unexpected behavior can occur. For example, suppose the user puts an asterisk (*) in this field and submits the form. Depending on the configuration, the directory server could respond to the LDAP query with a list of every user in the directory services tree. You do not want an attacker to be able to see all the users in your tree. An attacker could even use this field to view the attributes of a user object, such as the password. An XML injection attack manipulates the XML structure used by an XML-based application or service. It inserts malicious content into the structure, which can affect the application's output. An XML injection attack might cause your CDATA field to be ignored by your XML parser and input validation filters. It will slip by. In this example, the payload contains a malicious URL. If the user clicks on the link thinking it's for something else, it will actually go to that user's banking account and run a cross-site request forgery attack. This is just a simple example, and the result of the attack would depend on what the malicious URL contains. Let's review command-injection attacks. The purpose of this attack is to inject and execute commands in a vulnerable application. The vulnerable application runs commands on behalf of the attacker with the privileges assigned to the application itself. Let's suppose a Linux server is running the DNS service. If an attacker was able to exploit this service, they could then run commands on this Linux server. This was a very popular attack several years ago. Many system administrators ran this service as the root user account, which allowed them to run commands with full access. To combat this attack, you should never run a service as an administrative user. Instead, create a limited user account on the system that only has access to what the service requires and nothing more. Let's look at one more variation of the injection attack called the directory traversal attack or path traversal attack. This attack's goal is to gain access to a specific file stored elsewhere in the file system. It usually exploits some type of vulnerability in the application itself, such as not properly validating user input. In this case, characters representing the path to the parent directory on the application server could be manipulated to allow access to secure files. For example, let's say there is a file directory with two subdirectories. Inside subdirectory A, there is a file named 123. Inside subdirectory B, there is a file named 456. The user, in this case, only has access to file 456, and he can search the directory hierarchy for a vulnerability and access file 123. Because of this vulnerability, web applications need to be coded such that they look for all characters that could be used for directory traversal, whether it's the actual characters (\"..\", \"/\", \"\\\") or their percent encoded equivalents. In this lesson, we looked at injection attacks. We have covered LDAP, XML, and command injection attacks. We ended by looking at directory traversal attacks.",
