If they're not implemented correctly, passwords can be an operating system vulnerability. To mitigate this issue, passwords should be complex. This means that they should be at least 12 characters long and include capital letters, numbers, and symbols. In a high-security environment, passwords alone are just too vulnerable; multi-factor authentication is a must. Multi-Factor authentication uses two or more authentication factors, such as something you know, like a password or a pin; something you have, like a smart card; or something you are, like a retina scan. Another hardening technique is to limit operating system exposure. To do this, you should first ensure that administrative privileges are only provided to system administrators. Next, system management should ensure that users are only given the rights and permissions required to do their jobs – nothing more. This concept is called the principle of least privilege. You should also ensure that only the software used by administrators and users is installed on your systems. Removing unnecessary software reduces the attack surface, giving hackers fewer chances to exploit a system. For that reason, you should disable unnecessary or non-essential services. Unused services often aren't configured securely or configured at all. They're attractive to hackers, and sustained attacks can go unnoticed. Examples of non-essential services are TFTP, Telnet, and SNMP. These are all clear text services. DNS, ICMP, and NTP are essential protocols and services. If your system isn't a DNS server, you'll want to disable the DNS service. It's good to note that in Windows 10, some of these services are disabled by default, such as Telnet and TFTP. Systems should also be protected with security software, such as antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, and personal or client firewall software. When you use this type of security software, ensure that it comes from a trusted publisher and doesn't conflict with other programs in use. Another aspect of hardening an operating system is to develop system baselines. A baseline is a standard applied to systems. It defines standards for configuration management, security policies, software and backup policies, and several other topics. Developing standard baselines helps ensure that an organization is working at peak efficiency and security base. If baselines are appropriately configured and applied, it becomes fairly easy to detect systems that may be vulnerable since they're operating outside established standards. There are several types of baselines to consider. A configuration baseline establishes the standard configuration for all systems. This baseline defines the default system configuration, including loaded software, enabled services, and domain connectivity. Further configuration and changes to the configuration can be achieved via Group Policies. A security baseline defines the secure computing components, such as the security software used to protect individual systems, that are installed and configured on your workstations. Definition updates and changes are all configured and ready to go as part of the baseline. In addition, any enterprise hardware such as firewalls, gateways, and SPAM filters (and their configurations) are specified as part of this baseline. A software & use baseline defines acceptable system use and supported software. Software managers can control a user's ability to employ software. This can also help administrators by keeping track of use licenses and, potentially, reduce expenditures by limiting the number of purchased software use licenses. It also helps define appropriate use policies by defining how to implement Group Policies to provide allowed services while preventing unauthorized use of disallowed services. As a whole, baselines should be reviewed and modified to reflect the changes organizations make constantly. When new software or new versions of existing software are introduced, the baseline must be changed to reflect the update. If security policies change, such as the frequency of password changes or password complexity requirements, the baseline must be updated again. Baselines are not static. They should be thought of as a guideline or practice to ensure the efficient and safe use of computer systems. Further, they should reduce the attack surface that threat actors can exploit to gain access to your system. The last topic for this lesson is patch management. Patch management is the process of managing patches for all of your systems. A patch management system can provide centralized control. A common system is Microsoft's patch management product Windows Software Update Service, or WSUS for short. Patch management activities include determining which patches are needed on your systems, applying the patches, and then auditing for the successful application of those patches. Before patches are applied, a small group of deployments is usually tested, especially for service packs. If a problem exists with the patch process, it's much easier to handle a small deployment than to face a system-wide crisis. This group is generally comprised of power users who know how to fix issues. They're given additional permissions and rights so they can continue working if something goes wrong with deployment. Larger organizations may have a lab that represents the types of systems in use by users throughout the enterprise. Tests are conducted within the lab and verified before they're released to the general user community. A best practice is to create a system restore point before you patch systems just in case something goes wrong. Now, sometimes, a patch is overkill, so we also have hot fixes to choose from. Hot fixes are quick fixes for problems. Usually, you don't install the hot fix unless you have the specific problem it's intended for. Hot fixes sometimes address a specific customer situation and may be distributed only to that customer. Hot fixes are also commonly used to address freshly discovered security holes. A patch could also be a temporary quick fix. Generally, a manufacturer tests patches more than a hot fix, and patches are designed for wider deployment. Patches can include hot fixes that the manufacturers have thoroughly tested for mass deployment. Patches typically contain fixes for security holes and discovered system bugs. As an example, Microsoft releases security patches once per month. Service packs are installable packages that include several patches from the same vendor for various applications. Service packs usually include patches and hot fixes that have been tested by the manufacturer for wide deployment. Before fully deploying the service pack, you'll usually let a small designated group test it to make sure it's fully compatible with your system. But if you have a specific issue, you may want to install a patch or a hot fix immediately. That's it for this lesson. In this video, we talked about operating system hardening. First, we discussed the importance of using secure passwords, limiting administrative privileges, installing only needed, secure software, and removing non-essential services. Next, we discussed the role baselines play in keeping our systems secure. We ended this lesson by discussing the importance of applying the latest patches and service packs to your systems.",
