There are several different services you can use to harden applications or services. One of them is called SELinux. It's a cool access control security feature. Essentially, the idea behind SELinux is that you use the operating system kernel to limit what a particular application is allowed to do, and it goes beyond the limitations that you set with permissions or privileges based on the user account. Think of it as a roadblock to help prevent hackers from doing more damage. SELinux can be set to determine access between users, files, directories, memory, ports, and sockets. First, we're going to type ‘sestatus'. this will tell us if SELinux is enforcing the system. Next, we'll take a look at the SELinux config file located in ‘/etc/selinux/config'. This config file sets the permanent state of SELinux. It's recommended to set your system to permissive first, install all your needed applications, and then view the logs to make the necessary changes to SELinux. The permissive setting logs all the permission denied errors while allowing an application to run. Any changes to the SELinux config file located in /etc/selinux/config requires a reboot. Two places we can look for SELinux permission denied errors are in the audit log and journalctl. Let's take a look at the audit log, ‘less /var/log/audit/audit.log'. We're going to use a question mark and search for ‘AVC', which is a type of SELinux error. As you can see, there's some denied messages from other applications that we should probably look at. Let's exit out of here and look at ‘journalctl'. SELinux errors may be in red if there's a problem to address. We don't have much time to search through the logs right now, but this should give you a good idea of where to look. If a service is unable to start, it might cause SELinux to deny permission to certain aspects that allow the application to run. When you need to determine the cause of a problem, logs are your friend. Let's type ‘clear' to clear our screen. By default, SELinux has hundreds of Booleans that are essentially off and on switches for certain tasks. To view the whole list of Booleans, type ‘getsebool -a'. Let's say I only want to see Booleans related to samba. Let's type ‘getsebool -a | grep samba'. To enable a Boolean, we can use the setsebool command. There's one in particular that we want to enable called samba_share_nfs. This one grants samba rights to export NFS volumes. To set this, type ‘setsebool samba_share_nfs 1 -P'. Now, if we go back and type ‘getsebool -a | grep samba', you'll see that samba_share_nfs is set to On. When SELinux is enforced, it uses a categorization system called context types. These are labels with addition information related to its purpose, user, role, and such. Today, we're just going to cover the basics. One useful command you can use to view the context type is the -Z flag. Let take a look at the context types for the samba configuration folder. Type ‘ls -lZ /etc/samba'. As you can see, there's additional information listed here that gives a label to samba so SELinux knows these are samba configuration files. If a configuration file was made in a /home directory and then copied to an /etc config directory, it may not have the right context type when copied. This could prevent applications from working correctly and show a denied message from SELinux in the logs. And that's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we looked at hardening Linux applications using SELinux. We talked about how SELinux can protect your system using access control security. Then we saw some of the commands for managing SELinux and how to troubleshoot permission denied errors from SELinux.",

      "summary": "SELinux is a security mechanism that leverages the operating system kernel to enforce strict access controls beyond standard user permissions, acting as a barrier against potential attacks. It allows administrators to manage access to users, files, and system resources, with a recommended initial configuration of permissive mode for application installation and log monitoring. Key troubleshooting involves analyzing audit logs and journalctl for permission denied errors to identify and resolve issues impacting application functionality.",
