  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script In this demonstration, we'll look at requiring IPsec for communications between two network hosts. We'll use a Windows server and a Windows workstation. To secure communications with IPsec, we use the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. Let's search for Windows Defender Firewall. There it is. Let's expand this. You'll notice that no rules are defined in the connection security rules here, so we need to define a new rule. To define a new rule, you right-click Connection Security Rules and create a New Rule. The wizard displays. First, we choose the type of rule to use for IPsec. We have several options. We could configure an Isolation rule, which restricts connections based on authentication criteria such as domain membership or health status. We have an Authentication exemption, which will prevent authenticated connections with specific computers, in other words, it exempts computers from connecting. We have Server-to-server rules. These authenticate connections between specified computers. Tunnel rules authenticate connections between two computers; it creates a tunnel between the two. We also can create Custom rules. We want to set up an Isolation rule. We'll select Isolation. Click Next. Now, we need to specify how to enforce authentication. You can either request to use IPsec or require the use of IPsec. If you request, the default option is the computer that attempts to use IPsec. If either computer in the communication channel can't use IPsec, it fails over to unsecured communications. Notice that this rule is applied to both inbound and outbound connections. If this rule isn't secure enough, then you can increase security by requiring IPSec for inbound and outbound connections. We'll request authentication for inbound and outbound connections. Click Next, which is the default option. Now, we determine the type of authentication method we want to use. The first option, the Default, is to use whatever authentication methods are specified in the default IPsec settings. Most of the time, you'll use computer-based Kerberos. To use Kerberos, both computers must be in the same Active Directory forest. You also have the option to specify Computer and user Kerberos. Choosing this option also requires both computers to be in the same Active Directory forest. The systems must be re-authenticated using user authentication. In this demo, we'll use Computer authentication. There's also an Advanced option. After you select Advanced, click Customize. Customize allows you to set up multiple authentication methods. If the first method we set up fails, the system defaults to the next available authentication type. On the left, we specify the first authentication method. If we click Add, the options are a computer using Kerberos, a computer using NTLM, or a certificate from a trusted certificate authority. That last option is useful if both computers aren't in the same Active Directory forest. In this case, we can use certificates to authenticate both ends of the communication channel. We'll configure both computers to trust the issuing CA of the certificates used on the computers. We'll browse through to select the certificates that we want to use. We also have the option of using a pre-shared key that would be used by both computers. It's noted here that this isn't recommended. A pre-shared key is the least secure option of these four. Let's go ahead and click Cancel. On the left, we specify the first authentication method. If the authentication doesn't work, the system will use the second authentication method we configured here on the right. For this demo, both hosts are members of the same domain, so we'll use computer-based Kerberos authentication. Now we'll click Next. Now, we can specify the network location profile to which this rule will be applied. Because we have a desktop workstation and a server that are members of the same domain and will always be attached to the same network, we can select domain. However, if you have a roaming computer such as a laptop, notebook, or something of that sort, this becomes a little more of an issue. While at work, the notebook or laptop would use the domain profile. When the computer is used from home or another location, it would use a public or private profile on the system, depending on where we connect. For our purposes today, we'll use all three of these profiles. We could turn one or more of them off if we wanted to restrict that. Now, we need to name this rule. We'll enter Request IPsec policy. Click Finish. At this point, the rule has been configured, but we've configured only one-half of the communication channel. We'll go to the workstation side and configure the same rule here. On the workstation side, we'll go to the Search box and type Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. We'll go to Connection Security Rules and right-click. We'll configure this IPsec rule like we did on the server system. Click Isolation and then Next. Now, we'll click Request authentication for inbound and outbound connections. We'll go to Computer Kerberos and leave all three. We'll name it Request IPsec and click Finish. From the workstation, let's initiate communications between these two computers. We'll go back to the Search box and open a command prompt. We'll ping the IP address of the server system. If we don't know the IP address of the server system, we can go over to the server system, open the Command Prompt, and run ipconfig. You can see the server address here: 172.16.50.110. Back to our workstation, ping 172.16.50.110. We want this to be a continuous ping, so we'll cancel and restart it with the -t flag to continuously send pings. You can see we're getting replies from that address. That's perfect. We've established that we can ping the server. The pinging process will continue, and we can monitor the connection between the two computers. We can see the replies from the server, and it just keeps running. Now, let's switch back to the server and go back to Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. We can see the connection rule. Let's go to the Monitoring tab so we can monitor the connection. If we go to the Connection Security Rule, we can see that the Request IPsec rule is currently in progress. We'll go to Security Associations. Here, we can look inside the Main Mode or Quick Mode and see the connections between our Windows 11 machine and server. We see information that the connection is working. There are two modes, the main mode and quick mode because IPsec tunnels are built in two different phases. Phase one is called main mode. Phase two is quick mode. Breaking the monitoring information into these two modes is useful. It allows you to troubleshoot each phase of the connection establishment process. Here, in Main Mode, we see information about the connection. We have the two endpoints here. We can see that this address here is the Windows Server. This is the workstation address here and the remote address. We can also see that we're using Kerberos authentication here. We're not requiring a second authentication at the moment. If we scroll over or look at this side, we can see the encryption in the data integrity mode. Let's right-click and go to Properties. We can see a little more information about the connection. Let's click Cancel. We can do the same thing for Quick Mode and see the same information. Again, we can see both ends of the communication: a local address and a remote address. We can see that AH and ESP are components of quick mode. Before we leave Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, we want to show you the global settings. Recall earlier when we set up our rule. We right-clicked Connection Security Rules. From there, we clicked New Rule, Request authentication, and then authentication method. The default is to use the authentication method specified in IPsec settings. Now, we can configure IPsec settings in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security. That way, we don't have to manually configure these settings each time we set up a rule. We can use the default option. Let's select Cancel. Now, we'll go to Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, right-click, go to Properties, and then go to the IPsec tab. Here, we configure the IPsec setting defaults. These are the settings applied unless you override them manually when you create the rules. Let's click Customize. We can configure how the key exchange works. Select Advanced, then select Customize, and specify the Security methods used. We can enter a specific algorithm to use or specify key lifetimes. These are settings for the main mode; data protection is for quick mode. If we click Advanced on data protection from quick mode and click Customize on this screen, we can configure the AH and ESP algorithms for data integrity and encryption. Note that we have the algorithm listed first or the algorithm that's used first. Remember that integrity ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with in transit; that's hashing. Encryption encrypts the data so that it can't be sniffed and read. Let's click Cancel. We can configure the default authentication method. We can set that to Computer Kerberos if we want. We used that when we set up the rule. Let's click Cancel because we don't want to set these defaults right now. Click Cancel again. The last thing we need to review is the tools you can use to manage IPsec communications from the command line. Let's go to the command prompt. We'll type netsh advfirewall and ?. It displays the commands we have available. We'll use the consec command. Let's press Up and run the consec command. Here, you see the commands available within this context. We can add a new connection, delete all matching connection security rules, display the configuration script, display a list of commands, set new values for properties of an existing rule, and display a specified connection security rule. That's it for this demonstration. In this demonstration, we used IPsec to secure communications between two network hosts. We used Windows Firewall with Advanced Security to set up connection security rules on both sides of the communication. We also set up secured communications between a Windows server system and a Windows client system. We then used the ping command to establish communications between the two hosts. We monitored the connection to verify that IPsec was being used to secure communications between them. We then talked about configuring the IPsec defaults. We ended this demonstration by talking about how you can manage IPsec rules from the command line.",

      "content": "If we click Advanced on data protection from quick mode and click Customize on this screen, we can configure the AH and ESP algorithms for data integrity and encryption. Note that we have the algorithm listed first or the algorithm that's used first. Remember that integrity ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with in transit; that's hashing. Encryption encrypts the data so that it can't be sniffed and read. Let's click Cancel. We can configure the default authentication method. We can set that to Computer Kerberos if we want. We used that when we set up the rule. Let's click Cancel because we don't want to set these defaults right now. Click Cancel again.",
      "summary": "In the \"Configure Advanced Settings\" section of the CompTIA Security+ course, learners explore the configuration of Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) algorithms to ensure data integrity and encryption. The content emphasizes the importance of hashing for data integrity, which prevents tampering during transmission, and encryption to protect data from unauthorized access. Additionally, it discusses setting default authentication methods, such as Computer Kerberos, to enhance security protocols.",

It displays the commands we have available. We'll use the consec command. Let's press Up and run the consec command. Here, you see the commands available within this context. We can add a new connection, delete all matching connection security rules, display the configuration script, display a list of commands, set new values for properties of an existing rule, and display a specified connection security rule.",
      "summary": "This section covers the use of command-line tools for managing IPsec communications, specifically through the Windows netsh advfirewall command. Key functionalities include adding and deleting connection security rules, displaying configurations, and modifying existing rules. Practical applications involve enhancing network security by effectively managing IPsec settings to protect data in transit.",

We used Windows Firewall with Advanced Security to set up connection security rules on both sides of the communication. We also set up secured communications between a Windows server system and a Windows client system. We then used the ping command to establish communications between the two hosts. We monitored the connection to verify that IPsec was being used to secure communications between them. We then talked about configuring the IPsec defaults. We ended this demonstration by talking about how you can manage IPsec rules from the command line.",
      "summary": "This demonstration showcased the use of IPsec to secure communications between two network hosts, utilizing Windows Firewall with Advanced Security to establish connection security rules. It involved configuring secured communications between a Windows server and client, verifying the implementation of IPsec through monitoring, and discussing command line management of IPsec rules. Key concepts included the practical application of IPsec for enhancing network security and the importance of firewall configurations.",
