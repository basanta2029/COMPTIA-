As someone entering or advancing in IT security, you need to develop a strong grasp of the foundational strategies that help protect digital resources from compromise. This module will guide you through essential concepts and practical defenses, enabling you to recognize vulnerabilities in modern systems and implement effective protections to secure both the data and the infrastructure that underpin your organization. Throughout the lessons, you will explore a range of topics, from hardening operating systems and securing file servers to understanding and mitigating wireless threats. You'll also delve into emerging areas such as application development security and safeguarding data during transmission. By engaging in this module, you'll not only acquire valuable theoretical knowledge, but you'll also gain hands-on skills that will be directly applicable in your cybersecurity career. Strengthen core systems by applying industry-standard operating system hardening techniques. Secure file servers to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or loss. Evaluate and reinforce Linux host security measures specific to open-source environments. Identify common wireless threats and deploy effective countermeasures to protect network communications. Recognize best practices in application and web security, including secure development and defense against attacks.",
