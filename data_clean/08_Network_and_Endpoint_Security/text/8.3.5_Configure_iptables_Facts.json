  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 This lesson covers the following topics: Chains Actions performed Example iptables commands Chains The Linux iptables firewall utility uses policy chains (sets of rules) to allow or block network traffic. When a connection is initiated to your system, iptables looks for a matching rule. If it doesn't find one, it uses the default action in the tables. Be aware that iptables almost always come pre-installed on any Linux distribution. The filter table in iptables has three chains. The following table describes them. Chain Description Input\tThis chain controls the behavior of incoming connections. For example, if a user attempts to ping the system, iptables attempts to match the IP address and port to a rule in the input chain. Forward\tThis chain is used for packets leaving the system. These are incoming connections that aren't delivered locally. In other words, the traffic is not destined for the router; the router forwards the traffic to the destination device. Output\tThis chain is used for outgoing connections. For example, if you ping testout.com, iptables check its output chain to see what the rules are regarding ping and testout.com before allowing or denying the ping request. Actions Performed You can accept, drop, or reject the connections. After you define your accept rules, you should create a rule to drop all other traffic to prevent unauthorized access to the system. Action\tResult Accept\tAllows the connection. Drop\tDrops the connection. For example, an IP address in a rule with a drop action pings your system; the request is dropped. No response is sent to the user. Reject\tRejects the connection but will send a response back. This lets the sender know that the traffic reached a system but was rejected.
