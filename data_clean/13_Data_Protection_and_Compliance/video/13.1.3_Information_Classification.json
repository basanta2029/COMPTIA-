There are several types of data, and data needs to be classified and secured. First, let's go over general classifications of data. All data falls into one of five categories. Public data is available to anyone. Private data has limited distribution. Sensitive data is for internal use. Critical data is covered by laws and compliance regulations. Proprietary data is exclusive to a particular entity. Let's look at each of these in detail. The first information classification is Public. This classification allows anyone to have a copy of the information. Examples include a public website that everyone can access, company brochures, and marketing material. This data exists to be released. Private data is not for general release to the public. It includes internal email addresses, company meeting notes, company presentations, and customer lists. This is information you don't want released to the public, but if it were accidentally released, damage to your organization would be light to moderate. Sensitive data is information that, if exposed, could cause significant damage to an organization. Sensitive data is restricted even within the company that's responsible for it. It may include strategic information, customer lists, personally identifiable information (PII), and company strategies. Critical data includes personally identifiable information, credit card data, health records, and other information covered under compliance regulations. These include The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and The California Consumer Protection Act. The disclosure of critical data will cause severe harm and financial penalties. Proprietary information includes information that's unique and differentiates a company from its competitors. Examples are Google's search algorithm, the recipe for Coca-Cola, or patents granted for inventions and processes. The release of this information would cause serious damage, maybe even irreparable damage. Now let's talk about very specific kinds of data that need to be classified by a company. This data is covered by laws, government regulations, and compliance acts. The first is classified data. Personal Identifiable Information includes almost any data that can be used to identify a person: their name, addresses, email, phone number, or even a photograph. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has many facets, but the one that concerns you most as a security administrator is their policy on Electronic Health Information, or eHI. This classification includes data related to an individual's health and information collected by doctors, health clinics, health insurance companies, and employers. It must be secured in all usage states– at rest, in use, or in motion. The exposure, loss, or breach of this data incures significant fines from the U.S. government. Financial data is covered by a few laws and compliance bodies. It includes consumer credit card information, bank account numbers, and corporate financial requirements. There are also government/military classification levels. The public can view Unclassified information. The next classification is Sensitive, but Unclassified. For this classification, the government or military would prefer the information not be available to the public, but it is unclassified. Disclosure could cause harm, but the harm would be minimal. The next level is Confidential. It allows restricted information release under the Freedom of Information Act. The level above that is Secret, and it includes troop movements, deployments, and overall capabilities. The highest classification is Top Secret. Release of Top-Secret information can pose a grave threat to the country and national security. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we covered the different data classifications and examples of data in each classification: public, private, sensitive, and critical. Then we looked at specific types of data, including PII, ePHI, credit cards, and unclassified, confidential, secret, and top-secret.",
