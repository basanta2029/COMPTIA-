It's not enough to delete the data. Reformatting the hard drive is not even sufficient. If other people can access your computer, they can use data remanence, the residual representation of erased data, to recover information. You must damage the hardware so badly that the remanence is gone. And don't paper documents. Even in our digital world, a lot of sensitive information is available in print, and you must destroy that information, too. If someone obtains your data, it might be used to crack passwords, sell identification information, or steal trade secrets. That's why it's essential to be familiar with the tools, techniques, and government laws that apply to data destruction. There are wrong ways to destroy data and then there is the right way. You must use specialized tools to destroy data remanence, so information is impossible to retrieve. Data destruction tools use one of three techniques. Software programs write random code over and over on top of the original data so that anything that can be recovered from the hardware is just gibberish. Hardware tools damage hard disk drives so severely that it is impossible to retrieve even pieces of data from the drive. There are also techniques that destroy the ink on paper so that it's impossible to read. Let's look at sanitization programs first. Sanitization programs wipe data off your computer without damaging hardware. This is commonly called purging, wiping, or clearing. These techniques remove data from the hard disk and then write over it so many times that the data remanence is destroyed. Media sanitization options do not destroy the hard disk for future use. There are many data sanitization software programs you can use to purge information, and some of them are even free. Each has pros and cons; carefully consider the media type you are purging, the level of data sensitivity, your budget, and other factors when you select a sanitization software. The following options severely damage hardware storage so that the device can never be used again. One technique is running a hard disk through a disk shredder, physically destroying the drive. Disk shredders are effective, but also relatively expensive. Some organizations without a disk shredder will destroy a disk by hammering or drilling holes into the disk platters. Drilling and hammering are relatively inexpensive and fairly efficient. However, they are not as effective as a shredder. Another option is hiring a company to destroy disks. Many companies that provide this service will also provide a certificate of destruction. Pulverizing is like shredding, except that it uses a punch press or hammer system to crush a hard disk into a pile of metal confetti. Many companies that provide disk shredding also provide pulverizing. One really effective technique is degaussing. Degaussing purges the hard disk by exposing it to an incredibly high magnetic pulse that destroys all the data on the disk. It also ruins the motors inside the drive. Remember how we mentioned that you also need to destroy paper documents that contain sensitive information? Most offices contain paper shredders, which shred documents into very small pieces, as small as one-seventeenth of an inch which are then mixed with other trash. But these paper pieces still contain ink. There are two methods that destroy the ink on the paper: burning and pulping. Burning documents is a pretty simple process. Build a small fire somewhere legal and safe, then use metal tongs to burn your documents one by one or a few at a time. It's important to ensure that each document is turned into ash, if sensitive information escapes the flames and flies away, it might fall into the wrong hands. Burning blank papers with your critical documents makes things more confusing if someone tries to piece them back together. Be sure to sift through all the remains and make sure every bit of paper has turned to ash before you dispose of the burnt remnants. Pulping is a way of removing all traces of ink from paper by using chemicals and then mashing the paper into pulp. Since these chemicals can ruin carpet and clothing, you should perform this process outside and use protective gloves. First, you need to remove the documents from envelopes, unfold them, and place them in a large trash can filled with nine parts water and one part liquid bleach. Second, completely submerge and soak the documents in the solution for 24 hours. Next, use a broomstick or a heavy-duty mixer, such as a paint turbine mixer, to mash the paper into a pliable liquid pulp. After that, spread the pulp out to dry in the sun. Lastly, place the dried pulp into garbage bags and throw it in the trash. Now that we have discussed ways to permanently dispose of information, let's switching gears to talk about the legal requirements of data destruction, starting with data sovereignty. Data sovereignty is the concept that information stored in binary digital form is subject to government laws and regulations. Data sovereignty laws are created to maintain privacy and prevent foreign countries from subpoenaing, or searching, another's data. Data sovereignty laws evolve rapidly as cloud services and other new storage options emerge. It's imperative that you stay current with data sovereignty laws because every business must comply with state and federal data destruction regulations. Data sovereignty laws protect citizens from identity theft, companies from security breaches, and clients from privacy issues. They specify when, how, and what data you are allowed to destroy. Requirements vary depending on location, so make sure you comply with the most up-to-date version of both state and federal regulations, and remember, they frequently change to keep up with the pace of technology. No matter where you live in the US, you will have to follow laws dictated by three government acts: HIPAA, FACTA, and FISMA. HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA protects medical records and personal health information. Companies that provide healthcare insurance handle HIPAA-protected information. And, of course, companies that provide health-related services also handle HIPAA-protected information. FACTA, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, was created to protect against identity theft. It applies to the disposal of consumer reports and related information. FACTA includes credit reports, credit scores, employment history information, check writing history, insurance claims, residential or tenant history, and medical history. Every business handles FACTA-protected information, and every business must comply with FACTA laws. FISMA, the Federal Information Security Management Act, protects government information. It is primarily concerned with proper data destruction and has detailed disposal requirements. Regardless of which destruction method you use and what type of information you destroy, you need to carefully document each disposal process with a certificate of destruction, or COD. A COD is usually necessary to satisfy internal security reporting requirements as well as legal reporting requirements. A COD should specify the device and the method and date of destruction. This document should also provide a chain of custody (each person who had possession of the data and the length of time they possessed the data). If you destroy a storage device yourself, you should create your own COD. You can find COD templates on the internet. If you contact a service provider to destroy your devices, request that they provide a COD for each device they process. Most organizations, especially military and government agencies, retain CODs as a permanent record of each device's destruction. Companies should have data retention policies and procedures for storing and destroying information. By law, organizations must retain certain information for specified time periods, and your business probably has additional records to keep and maintain. Always make absolutely certain that it is okay to destroy papers, data, and drives. Remember, proper data destruction is essential to securing information. Not only must you use specialized tools and techniques to damage the data beyond recovery, you must also comply with all necessary laws and company policies, including creating and maintaining a certificate of destruction. Following these guidelines will protect your organization from many security and legal problems.",
