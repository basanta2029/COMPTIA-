Data is a critical asset to all organizations, which must put specific policies in place for data creation, storage, and sharing. One important data protection aspect is data retention. Data retention policies define how to organize, maintain, and archive data. They also outline how and when to dispose of information. Different data types must be legally retained for different lengths of time, depending on relevant regulations. Most data retention policies also address how to handle information involved in litigation. When you're creating a data retention policy, you need to identify the various data types your organization uses. Develop a policy that defines how long each data type should be retained as well as how they should be destroyed when the retention time expires. It's important to record this information in a policy that's clearly written. Having a written policy and ensuring that everyone in the organization follows it helps to protect you from evidence tampering accusations. Adhering to your data retention policy protects both you and your organization. You should never allow selective or arbitrary information destruction, which could make it appear as though you're trying to hide evidence and could lead to criminal charges. Never destroy information after it's been subpoenaed or if you have reason to believe that it may be subpoenaed in the future. Evidence destruction and obstruction of justice are serious crimes that can result in imprisonment. With this in mind, let's take a look at some examples of data retention rules. These rules aren't necessarily the ones that you'll use, but I'll go over them to give you ideas on how you can formulate your own policies. Email inboxes can pile up quickly, so the first rule could state that all email messages are to be deleted after 90 days. The IRS defines guidelines for maintaining tax records. To ensure compliance, you could say that your policy is to keep company tax records for seven years and employee tax records for four. After that time, they're to be shredded. When it comes to employee HR records, a good rule of thumb is to keep them for three to four years. You might see fit to hold onto all employee-created research and design documents to prove their ownership. So for the next rule, let's say the policy is to keep any integral research, design, or patent documents for 25 years. Next, are vendor contracts, service-level agreements, and other types of contractual documents. A good practice is to keep these until five years after a contract has ended. After you create your written data retention policy, consider using information classification labels to identify which retention policy rules apply to which pieces of data. This allows you to automate the data retention and destruction process. Without classification labels, it's an extremely tedious process to try to manage decades-long data records. Having a solid data retention policy has a lot of benefits. First, it reduces the discovery-request cost in the event of legal action against your organization. Responding to discovery requests can be time consuming and costly. You significantly minimize your discovery costs if all your old, irrelevant material has already been destroyed. Second, it reduces exposure during the discovery process. By minimizing the amount of electronic material that your organization keeps on hand, you also reduce the amount of information that could potentially expose your organization to litigation. Third, it lowers the hardware and software requirements for storing old data and minimizes clutter. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we talked about data protection and how to create data retention policies for your organization. We also talked about what specifically a data retention policy is and the good practices you should follow when creating one.",
