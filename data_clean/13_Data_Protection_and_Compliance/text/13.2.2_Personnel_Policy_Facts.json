  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 Personnel policies play a vital role in establishing clear guidelines, expectations, and standards for employees. They provide a framework for effective management of human resources and maintain a fair, legally compliant, and productive work environment. Personnel policies promote consistency, clear communication, employee development, conflict resolution, and risk management. Organizations can enhance employee satisfaction, attract and retain talent, and mitigate legal and operational risks by implementing effective personnel policies. Personnel Management Conduct policies Training topics and techniques Reporting and monitoring Personnel Management Human Resources (HR) policies for personnel management are applied in three phases: Recruitment (hiring) — locating and selecting people to work in particular job roles. Security issues here include screening candidates and performing background checks. Operation (working) — it is often the HR department that manages the communication of policy and training to employees (though there may be a separate training and personal development department within larger organizations). As such, it is critical that HR managers devise training programs that communicate the importance of security to employees. Termination or Separation (firing or retiring) — whether an employee leaves voluntarily or involuntarily, termination is a difficult process, with numerous security implications. Background Checks A background check determines that a person is who they say they are and are not concealing criminal activity, bankruptcy, or connections that would make them unsuitable or risky. Employees working in high confidentiality environments or with access to high-value transactions will obviously need to be subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny. For some jobs, especially federal jobs requiring a security clearance, background checks are mandatory. Some background checks are performed internally, whereas others are done by an external third party. Onboarding Onboarding at the HR level is the process of welcoming a new employee to the organization. The same sort of principle applies to taking on new suppliers or contractors. Some of the same checks and processes are used in creating customer and guest accounts. As part of onboarding, the IT and HR function will combine to create an account for the user to access the computer system, assign the appropriate privileges, and ensure the account credentials are known only to the valid user. These functions must be integrated, to avoid creating accidental configuration vulnerabilities, such as IT creating an account for an employee who is never actually hired. Some of the other tasks and processes involved in onboarding include the following: Secure Transmission of Credentials — creating and sending an initial password or issuing a smart card securely. The process needs protection against rogue administrative staff. Newly created accounts with simple or default passwords are an easily exploitable backdoor. Asset Allocation — provision computers or mobile devices for the user or agree to the use of bring-your-own-device handsets. Training/Policies — schedule appropriate security awareness and role-relevant training and certification. Offboarding An exit interview (or offboarding) is the process of ensuring that an employee leaves a company gracefully. Offboarding is also used when a project using contractors or third parties ends. In terms of security, there are several processes that must be completed: Account Management — disable the user account and privileges. Ensure that any information assets created or managed by the employee but owned by the company are accessible (in terms of encryption keys or password-protected files). Company Assets — retrieve mobile devices, keys, smart cards, USB media, and so on. The employee will need to confirm (and in some cases prove) that they have not retained copies of any information assets. Personal Assets — wipe employee-owned devices of corporate data and applications. The employee may also be allowed to retain some information assets (such as personal emails or contact information), depending on the policies in force. The departure of some types of employees should trigger additional processes to re-secure network systems. Examples include employees with detailed knowledge of security systems and procedures, and access to shared or generic account credentials. These credentials must be changed immediately. Conduct Policies Operational policies include privilege/credential management, data handling, and incident response. Other important security policies include those governing employee conduct and respect for privacy. Acceptable Use Policy Enforcing an acceptable use policy (AUP) is important to protect the organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment. Typically, the policy will forbid the use of equipment to defraud, defame, or to obtain illegal material. It will prohibit the installation of unauthorized hardware or software and explicitly forbid actual or attempted snooping of confidential data that the employee is not authorized to access. Acceptable use guidelines must be reasonable and not interfere with employees' fundamental job duties or privacy rights. An organization's AUP may forbid use of Internet tools outside of work-related duties or restrict such use to break times. Code of Conduct and Social Media Analysis A code of conduct, or rules of behavior, sets out expected professional standards. For example, employees' use of social media and file sharing poses substantial risks to the organization, including threat of virus infection or systems intrusion, lost work time, copyright infringement, and defamation. Users should be aware that any data communications, such as email, made through an organization's computer system are likely stored within the system, on servers, backup devices, and so on. Such communications are also likely to be logged and monitored. Employers may also subject employees' personal social media accounts to analysis and monitoring, to check for policy infringements. Rules of behavior are also important when considering employees with privileged access to computer systems. Technicians and managers should be bound by clauses that forbid them from misusing privileges to snoop on other employees or to disable a security mechanism. Use of Personally Owned Devices in the Workplace Portable devices, such as smartphones, USB sticks, media players, and so on, pose a considerable threat to data security, as they make file copying so easy. Camera and voice-recording functions are other obvious security issues. Network access control, endpoint management, and data loss prevention solutions can be of some use in preventing the attachment of such devices to corporate networks. Some companies may try to prevent staff from bringing such devices on-site. This is quite difficult to enforce, though. Also important to consider is the unauthorized use of personal software by employees or employees using software or services that has not been sanctioned for a project (shadow IT). Personal software may include either locally installed software or hosted applications, such as personal email or instant messenger, and may leave the organization open to a variety of security vulnerabilities. Such programs may provide a route for data exfiltration, a transport mechanism for malware, or possibly software license violations for which the company might be held liable, just to name a few of the potential problems. Clean Desk Policy A clean desk policy means that each employee's work area should be free from any documents left there. The aim of the policy is to prevent sensitive information from being obtained by unauthorized staff or guests at the workplace. Training Topics and Techniques It is necessary to frame security training in language that end users will respond to. Education should focus on responsibilities and threats that are relevant to users. It is necessary to educate users about new or emerging threats (such as fileless malware, phishing scams, or zero-day exploits in software), but this needs to be stated in language that users understand. Using a diversity of training techniques helps to improve engagement and retention. Training methods include facilitated workshops and events, one-on-one instruction and mentoring, plus resources such as computer-based or online training, videos, books, and blogs/newsletters. User and Role-Based Training Another essential component of a secure system is effective user training. Untrained users represent a serious vulnerability because they are susceptible to social engineering and malware attacks and may be careless when handling sensitive or confidential data. Train users in secure behavior. (Image by dotshock © 123RF.com.) Appropriate security awareness training needs to be delivered to employees at all levels, including end users, technical staff, and executives. Some of the general topics that need to be covered include the following: Overview of the organization's security policies and the penalties for noncompliance. Incident identification and reporting procedures. Site security procedures, restrictions, and advice, including safety drills, escorting guests, use of secure areas, and use of personal devices. Data handling, including document confidentiality, PII, backup, encryption, and so on. Password and account management plus security features of PCs and mobile devices. Awareness of social engineering and malware threats, including phishing, website exploits, and spam plus alerting methods for new threats. Secure use of software such as browsers and email clients plus appropriate use of Internet access, including social networking sites. There should also be a system for identifying staff performing security-sensitive roles and grading the level of training and education required (between beginner, intermediate, and advanced, for instance). Note that in defining such training programs you need to focus on job roles, rather than job titles, as employees may perform different roles and have different security training, education, or awareness requirements in each role. The NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework (nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice) sets out knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for different cybersecurity roles. Security awareness programs are described in SP800-50 (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf). Computer-Based Training and Gamification Participants respond well to the competitive challenge of CTF events. This type of gamification can be used to boost security awareness for other roles too. Computer-based training (CBT) allows a student to acquire skills and experience by completing various types of practical activities: Simulations — recreating system interfaces or using emulators so students can practice configuration tasks. Branching scenarios — having students choose between options to find the best choices to solve a cybersecurity incident or configuration problem. CBT might use video game elements to improve engagement. For example, students might win badges and level-up bonuses such as skills or digitized loot to improve their in-game avatar. Simulations might be presented so that the student chooses encounters from a map and engages with a simulation environment in a first person shooter type of 3D world. Critical Elements for Security Awareness Training Training employees about safe computer use is critical to protecting data and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks. (Image by rawpixel © 123RF.com.) Phishing campaigns used as employee training mechanisms involve simulated attacks to raise awareness and educate employees about the risks and consequences of falling victim to such attacks. By conducting mock phishing exercises, organizations aim to enhance threat awareness, protect sensitive information, mitigate social engineering risks, promote incident response, and strengthen security practices. Phishing attacks are prevalent and pose significant risks to many industries, making it essential for employees to know how to defend against them. Phishing is an effective attack vector due to its exploitation of human vulnerabilities, deceptive impersonation of trusted entities, psychological manipulation, broad reach, ease of use, dynamic capabilities, adaptability, and the potential for significant financial gain. These factors make phishing attacks difficult to detect, mitigate and underscore the importance of practicing vigilance and regularly training employees to recognize and respond effectively to phishing attempts. Through training, employees become more aware of common phishing techniques and deceptive tactics used by cybercriminals. This knowledge helps them to identify and report suspicious emails or messages, reducing the likelihood of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. By training employees to recognize phishing attempts, organizations mitigate social engineering risks. Employees learn to identify messages that use common tactics such as urgent requests, spoofed identities, and enticing offers to manipulate individuals. This knowledge helps protect employees and their organization from disclosing credentials or confidential data, or installing malware. Effective training enables employees to respond appropriately to phishing attempts, such as reporting incidents to specific IT or security teams, refraining from clicking suspicious links or opening attachments, and verifying requests sent via email using alternative channels. Training employees to recognize and respond to phishing attempts strengthens an organization's cybersecurity defenses. It cultivates a culture of security awareness, empowers employees to protect sensitive information actively, and enhances the organization's resilience against evolving threats. Complemented by simulated phishing campaigns, regular training programs help build a knowledgeable and security-conscious workforce. Security Awareness Training Lifecycle Security awareness training practices typically follow a lifecycle approach consisting of several stages. Security Awareness Training Lifecycle. The first phase is assessing the organization's security needs and risks. Planning and designing awareness training activities follow, where a comprehensive plan is developed, including objectives, topics, and delivery methods. Once a plan is created, the development stage focuses on creating engaging and informative training materials. Training is then delivered through previously identified delivery methods, such as in-person or computer-based sessions. Evaluation and feedback activities assess the training's effectiveness and gather participant insights. Security awareness is reinforced via reoccurring training activities to ensure it remains a priority and often includes refresher training, reminders, newsletters, and awareness campaigns. Monitoring and adaptation allow organizations to continually evaluate the program's impact and make necessary adjustments based on emerging risks and changing requirements. Organizations can establish a continuous and effective security awareness training program by following this lifecycle. It helps enhance employee knowledge, steer behaviors, and cultivate a security culture within the organization. Regular assessment, evaluation, and adaptation ensure that training remains relevant and addresses evolving security threats. A well-structured security awareness training program significantly contributes to mitigating risks, protecting sensitive data, and building a resilient cybersecurity posture. Development and Execution of Training Successfully executing security training means effectively providing education and instruction to employees and staff that enhance their knowledge, skills, and awareness of security practices. It involves delivering training programs addressing relevant security topics, like data protection, incident response, phishing awareness, secure coding practices, physical security, and many others. Content development focuses on creating engaging and informative training materials, using clear language, and incorporating real-world examples to enhance relevance and mix interactive elements like quizzes, case studies, or simulations to encourage active participation, critical thinking, and practical application of knowledge. Facilitating dialogue, discussion, and question-and-answer sessions further enhance the learning experience. To assess the effectiveness of security awareness practices, collecting feedback, conducting assessments, and developing relevant measurements and metrics help gauge the impact of the training and identify areas for improvement. Regular reviews and updates to training materials ensure that its content remains relevant and aligned with evolving security threats. Incorporating emerging best practices and industry trends help organizations stay current and enhance their security awareness practices. Reporting and Monitoring One way to gauge the efficacy of security awareness training is to assess its influence initially and through ongoing evaluations. Initial effectiveness refers to the immediate impact of security awareness training on participants. It measures the knowledge gained, awareness raised, and behavioral changes observed immediately after completing a training program. Evaluation methods can include pre-and post-training assessments, quizzes, and surveys designed to gauge participant understanding of security concepts before and after training. Measuring initial effectiveness provides insight into the immediate impact of training and how participants have absorbed the information and concepts presented. Recurring effectiveness assesses the long-term impact and sustainability of security awareness training by examining whether participants have retained and applied the knowledge and skills gained from training in their day-to-day activities. The focus is to measure the continued behavioral changes and the level of security consciousness within the organization over an extended period. Initial and recurring effectiveness measurements are crucial to gauge the overall impact of security awareness training. While measuring initial effectiveness shows the immediate outcomes and knowledge uptake, recurring effectiveness measurements ensure that the training has a lasting effect and leads to sustained improvements in security practices. Assessments and Quizzes — Conducting pre- and post-training assessments and quizzes allow organizations to measure the knowledge gained by employees during training. These reports provide quantitative data regarding training effectiveness related to knowledge retention and comprehension. Incident Reporting —Organizations can track and analyze incident reports to assess the training program's impact on incident detection and response, identifying any patterns or trends. Phishing Simulations —Conducting simulated phishing campaigns helps organizations evaluate employees' ability to recognize and respond to phishing attempts. Reports generated from these simulations provide data on click rates, successful phish captures, and trends in susceptibility, indicating the effectiveness of the training in mitigating phishing risks. Observations and Feedback —Managers and supervisors can provide feedback on employees' security practices and behaviors. Qualitative information such as this provides valuable insights into the practical application of training and any challenges employees face in implementing the knowledge gained. Metrics and Performance Indicators —Tracking relevant metrics, such as the number of reported incidents, employee compliance with security policies, or changes in password hygiene, provides quantitative data on the impact of security awareness training. These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the training program over time. Training Completion Rates —Monitoring the completion rates of security awareness training modules or sessions indicates employee engagement and adherence to training requirements. Higher completion rates suggest better participation and performance of the training content. Anomalous Behavior Anomalous behavior recognition refers to actions or patterns that deviate significantly from expectations. Examples include unusual network traffic, user account activity anomalies, insider threat actions, abnormal system events, and fraudulent transactions. Techniques such as network intrusion detection, user behavior analytics, system log analysis, and fraud detection are utilized to identify anomalous behavior. These techniques require monitoring and analyzing different data sources, comparing observed behavior against established baselines, and utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect deviations. Recognizing Risky Behaviors Risky behaviors are actions or practices that threaten data security, systems, or networks. These behaviors may involve unsafe online activities, such as clicking on suspicious links, visiting untrusted websites, or downloading unauthorized software. Risky behaviors can also include neglecting security measures, such as using weak passwords, sharing credentials, or ignoring software updates. Unexpected behaviors are actions that deviate from established security protocols or violate security policies. These behaviors can occur due to a lack of awareness, carelessness, or a failure to follow established procedures. Examples include unauthorized access to sensitive information, bypassing security controls, or disregarding physical security measures. Unintentional behaviors refer to actions without malicious intent but can still have detrimental consequences. These behaviors often stem from human error, lack of training, or lack of understanding of security best practices. Examples include accidental data breaches, mishandling of confidential information, or falling victim to social engineering attacks. All three types of behaviors (risky, unexpected, and unintentional) can lead to security incidents, data breaches, or the compromise of sensitive information. Individuals must be aware of these behaviors, follow security guidelines, stay informed about emerging threats, and practice good cybersecurity hygiene. Organizations are responsible for training and educating employees about these behaviors to promote a security-conscious culture and minimize the impact of human-related vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape.",

Evaluation methods can include pre-and post-training assessments, quizzes, and surveys designed to gauge participant understanding of security concepts before and after training. Measuring initial effectiveness provides insight into the immediate impact of training and how participants have absorbed the information and concepts presented. Recurring effectiveness assesses the long-term impact and sustainability of security awareness training by examining whether participants have retained and applied the knowledge and skills gained from training in their day-to-day activities. The focus is to measure the continued behavioral changes and the level of security consciousness within the organization over an extended period. Initial and recurring effectiveness measurements are crucial to gauge the overall impact of security awareness training. While measuring initial effectiveness shows the immediate outcomes and knowledge uptake, recurring effectiveness measurements ensure that the training has a lasting effect and leads to sustained improvements in security practices. Assessments and Quizzes — Conducting pre- and post-training assessments and quizzes allow organizations to measure the knowledge gained by employees during training. These reports provide quantitative data regarding training effectiveness related to knowledge retention and comprehension. Incident Reporting —Organizations can track and analyze incident reports to assess the training program's impact on incident detection and response, identifying any patterns or trends. Phishing Simulations —Conducting simulated phishing campaigns helps organizations evaluate employees' ability to recognize and respond to phishing attempts. Reports generated from these simulations provide data on click rates, successful phish captures, and trends in susceptibility, indicating the effectiveness of the training in mitigating phishing risks. Observations and Feedback —Managers and supervisors can provide feedback on employees' security practices and behaviors. Qualitative information such as this provides valuable insights into the practical application of training and any challenges employees face in implementing the knowledge gained. Metrics and Performance Indicators —Tracking relevant metrics, such as the number of reported incidents, employee compliance with security policies, or changes in password hygiene, provides quantitative data on the impact of security awareness training. These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the training program over time. Training Completion Rates —Monitoring the completion rates of security awareness training modules or sessions indicates employee engagement and adherence to training requirements. Higher completion rates suggest better participation and performance of the training content. Anomalous Behavior Anomalous behavior recognition refers to actions or patterns that deviate significantly from expectations. Examples include unusual network traffic, user account activity anomalies, insider threat actions, abnormal system events, and fraudulent transactions. Techniques such as network intrusion detection, user behavior analytics, system log analysis, and fraud detection are utilized to identify anomalous behavior. These techniques require monitoring and analyzing different data sources, comparing observed behavior against established baselines, and utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect deviations. Recognizing Risky Behaviors Risky behaviors are actions or practices that threaten data security, systems, or networks. These behaviors may involve unsafe online activities, such as clicking on suspicious links, visiting untrusted websites, or downloading unauthorized software. Risky behaviors can also include neglecting security measures, such as using weak passwords, sharing credentials, or ignoring software updates. Unexpected behaviors are actions that deviate from established security protocols or violate security policies. These behaviors can occur due to a lack of awareness, carelessness, or a failure to follow established procedures. Examples include unauthorized access to sensitive information, bypassing security controls, or disregarding physical security measures. Unintentional behaviors refer to actions without malicious intent but can still have detrimental consequences. These behaviors often stem from human error, lack of training, or lack of understanding of security best practices. Examples include accidental data breaches, mishandling of confidential information, or falling victim to social engineering attacks. All three types of behaviors (risky, unexpected, and unintentional) can lead to security incidents, data breaches, or the compromise of sensitive information. Individuals must be aware of these behaviors, follow security guidelines, stay informed about emerging threats, and practice good cybersecurity hygiene. Organizations are responsible for training and educating employees about these behaviors to promote a security-conscious culture and minimize the impact of human-related vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape.",
