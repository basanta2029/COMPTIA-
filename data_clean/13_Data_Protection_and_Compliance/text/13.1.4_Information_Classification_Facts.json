  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 The concept of data types refers to categorizing or classifying data based on its inherent characteristics, structure, and intended use. Data types provide a way to organize and understand the different data forms within a system or dataset. Classifying data into specific types makes analyzing, processing, interpreting, and securing information easier. Regulated data Trade secrets Legal and financial data Human-readable and non-human-readable data Data classifications Regulated Data Regulated data refers to specific categories of information subject to legal or regulatory requirements regarding their handling, storage, and protection. Regulated data typically includes sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) protected by laws and regulations to ensure privacy, security, and appropriate use. The types of regulated data vary depending on jurisdiction and the specific regulations applicable to the organization or data. Common examples of regulated data include financial information, healthcare records, social security numbers, credit card details, and other personally identifiable information. Privacy laws and industry-specific regulations often protect these data types, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare data or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for credit card information. Organizations that handle regulated data must comply with relevant laws and regulations governing its protection. Compliance typically involves implementing appropriate security measures, data encryption, access controls, data breach notification procedures, and data handling protocols. Organizations may also need to establish data storage, retention, and destruction safeguards to meet regulatory requirements. Trade Secrets Trade secret data refers to valuable, confidential information that gives a business a competitive advantage. Trade secrets encompass much nonpublic, proprietary information, including formulas, processes, methods, techniques, customer lists, pricing information, marketing strategies, and other business-critical data. Trade secrets have commercial value derived from their secrecy. Businesses often require employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to safeguard the confidentiality of trade secrets. Disclosure or unauthorized use of trade secret data is a serious legal matter. Companies can take legal action against individuals or organizations unlawfully acquiring, using, or disclosing trade secrets. Laws related to trade secrets vary across jurisdictions, but they generally aim to prevent unfair competition and provide remedies for misappropriation. Legal and Financial Data Legal and financial data encompass critical data for legal compliance, financial reporting, decision-making, and risk management.  Legal data includes documents, contracts, legal agreements, court records, litigation information, intellectual property filings, regulatory filings, and other legal documents. It may also encompass information related to corporate governance, compliance with laws and regulations, and legal obligations specific to an industry or jurisdiction. On the other hand, financial data pertains to information concerning an organization's financial activities, performance, and transactions, including financial statements, balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, audit reports, tax records, financial projections, budgets, and other financial reports. Financial data also encompasses details of financial transactions, such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger entries, and transactional records. Legal and financial data are highly sensitive and confidential due to their nature and the potential impact they can have on an organization's reputation, legal standing, and financial stability. Human-Readable and Non-Human-Readable Data Human-readable data refers to information humans can easily understand and interpret without additional processing or translation. Human-readable data describes a format that is accessible and readable, such as text, images, or multimedia content. Examples of human-readable data include documents, reports, emails, web pages, and presentations. On the other hand, non-human-readable data refers to data that is not easily understood or interpreted by humans in its raw form. It may be in a machine-readable format, such as binary code, encrypted data, or data represented in a complex structure or encoding that requires specialized software or algorithms to decipher and interpret. Non-human-readable data often requires additional processing or transformation to make it understandable to humans. Human-readable and non-human-readable data formats have distinct implications for security operations and controls. Human-readable and non-human-readable data formats impact security operations and controls in different ways. Security monitoring, user awareness, DLP, content filtering, and web security are more directly applicable to human-readable data formats. On the other hand, encryption, access controls, intrusion detection and prevention, secure data exchange, and code/application security are more relevant to non-human-readable data formats. It is important to note that non-human-readable data formats can impede the capabilities of security controls because non-human-readable data formats cannot be easily interpreted using traditional methods and require specialized approaches to inspect and protect them. A comprehensive security approach considers both types of data formats and implements appropriate measures to protect them based on their characteristics and associated risks. Data Classifications Data classification and typing schemas tag data assets so that they can be managed through the information lifecycle. A data classification schema is a decision tree for applying one or more tags or labels to each data asset. Many data classification schemas are based on the degree of confidentiality required: Public (unclassified) — there are no restrictions on viewing the data. Public information presents no risk to an organization if it is disclosed but does present a risk if it is modified or unavailable. Confidential (secret) — the information is highly sensitive, for viewing only by approved persons within the owner organization and possibly by trusted third parties under NDA. Critical (top secret) — the information is too valuable to allow any risk of its capture. Viewing is severely restricted. Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft Description Classification Description Proprietary\tProprietary information or intellectual property (IP) is information created and owned by the company, typically about the products or services they make or perform. IP is an obvious target for a company's competitors, and IP in some industries (such as defense or energy) is of interest to foreign governments. IP may also represent a counterfeiting opportunity (movies, music, and books, for instance). Private/personal data\tThis information relates to an individual identity. Private data examples include personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, social security numbers, financial information, and sensitive data like health records, login credentials, biometric data, and confidential business information. Sensitive\tThis label is usually used in the context of personal data privacy-sensitive information about a subject that could harm them if made public and could prejudice decisions made about them if referred to by internal procedures. As defined by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sensitive personal data includes religious beliefs, political opinions, trade union membership, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, genetic data, and health information (ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/legal-grounds-processing-data/sensitive-data/what-personal-data-considered-sensitive_en). Restricted\tThis classification refers to sensitive information that requires stringent controls and limited access due to its highly confidential nature. Restricted data typically includes data that, if disclosed or accessed by unauthorized individuals, could cause significant harm to individuals, organizations, or national security. Government and Military classifications can correspond to security-clearance levels used for military members, government officials, and civilian contractors. The structure will be similar to the following: Government Classification Explanation Unclassified\tData that is available for public use. No clearance is needed. Sensitive\tSensitive data is unclassified, but the government would prefer that the data not be public. Confidential\tConfidential data is information with limited distribution. No clearance is required. Secret\tThe first data classification that requires a security clearance. Top Secret\tThe highest level of data classification. Only those with Top Secret clearance can view the documents on a need-to-know basis. Top Secret Compartmentalized\tThis data is not any more secret than Top Secret but has very specific and limited distribution.",
