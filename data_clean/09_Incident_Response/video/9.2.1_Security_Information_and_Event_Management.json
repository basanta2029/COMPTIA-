We'll also explore log management. Monitoring a network requires experience and solid tools. One common network security tool is a scanner that can identify vulnerabilities and recommend remediation steps. The scan delivers output information to the IT administrators via the SIEM dashboard. The interval between scans is set by the IT department. This tool also scans servers, firewalls, switches, software programs, and even security cameras and wireless access points. There are many versions of SIEMs. Each one has different features and benefits, but all SIEMs have several features in common. One of these is the dashboard. These are generally customizable information screens that show real-time security and network information. This allows the IT security team to monitor events as they occur on the network. Sensors play a vital role in monitoring and securing a network. These sensors are set up at critical endpoints, services, and other vulnerable locations. They're programmed to send customized alerts to the SEIM if certain parameters are reached or exceeded. Before sensors are deployed, the IT security team sets their sensitivity. The benefit to variable sensitivity settings is the ability to customize the data that's sent to the SIEM. Not every company has the same needs, and that's what makes sensor-sensitivity customization so beneficial. Trends are patterns of activity discovered and reported to the SEIM. This is how baselines are established. These trends help security analysts decide if reported activity is normal or outside of the baseline. Trends that don't fit previously recorded ones can be investigated. As the IT security team investigates and documents these trends, it becomes easier for them to quickly spot an anomaly that may signal a security concern. Alerts are the SIEMs' way of letting the IT team know that a pre-established parameter has been contravened. The alert is intended to get the attention of the IT person who's monitoring the network. A best practice in this area is 24-hour monitoring. This means that weekends, holidays, and early hours are all filled. Hackers don't keep normal hours, and network equipment can break at the most inconvenient times! Event correlation is a critical part of using a SIEM solution. The software gathers data from log files, system applications, network appliances, and other endpoints in order to analyze it. This work is tedious, and people are inefficient at it. That's why the event-correlation feature is valuable. Not only does it gather data, but it analyzes and compares known malicious behavior against the aggregate data so that events aren't missed. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we learned about SIEMs and the features that make them a critical network component. These include customizable sensors and their placement. Trends help IT teams to establish baselines or norms for their network. Alerts provide critical information to the network monitor so that appropriate action can be taken. Event correlation automates a very laborious process and analyzes and compares aggregate data to known security behaviors and events, ensuring that nothing gets by undetected. All this is delivered to the IT team via a customizable dashboard for easy examination.",
