  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script Today, we'll be discussing isolation, containment, and segmentation within network security. Let's get started. Isolation is limiting the ability of a compromised asset or application from doing more harm to the network or its assets. This can be accomplished in a few different ways. One way is to practice process isolation. This ensures that if a process is compromised, only the resources used by that process are at risk. This practice applies to operating systems as well as RAM. In other words, it prevents any process that is limited by access bounds from accessing the resources of another process. This is a trait of a stable operating system. Isolation is considered a preventative security measure since it's implemented before an event is detected. Containment is the first step after an event has been detected and identified. This action can take a few forms. An IT admin may disconnect a machine from the network by simply unplugging the Ethernet cable or disabling the NIC. If this network is connected to other networks, this connection may be terminated. The decision to disconnect must be weighed against the amount of data being compromised and the potential loss of forensic evidence. No matter what, the goal of containment is to limit the damage potential of malicious activity. Containment requires action. Once an IT security analyst detects and identifies a malicious event, they must act. In this scenario, the analyst is monitoring a physical server that must be manually disconnected from network. This means the on-site IT Admin must jump into action as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence since this event threatens the physical server and also the servers in the branch office. This is because the two networks are connected via a VPN. Containment requires that the damage be limited—even if it means taking a server down. Segmentation is a strategic network design. The concept is simple: keep sections of a network separated so that malicious actors can't pivot within a network. Segmentation can be accomplished through VLANs, software-defined networks, switches, subnetting, or even physical segmentation. But simply being on a different subnet is not enough. Rules must be implemented to control what kind of communications can occur between assets on the network. Many times, a network admin will create a DMZ. This a virtual area where assets are kept separate from internal network assets. A network with a DMZ may have a single firewall or two firewalls depending on how secure this segment needs to be. No matter the topography, access between the DMZ and the internal network is secure and controlled. That's it for this lesson. We discussed isolation and how it's used to protect a network. Next, we talked about containment, which is the first action taken once an event has been detected. We ended by discussing network segmentation and how it can prevent unauthorized access.",

      "summary": "This section covers the critical concepts of isolation, containment, and segmentation in network security, emphasizing their roles in protecting sensitive data and minimizing the impact of security breaches. Isolation involves separating systems to prevent unauthorized access, containment focuses on limiting the spread of threats within a network, and segmentation divides networks into smaller, manageable parts to enhance security and performance. Practical applications include implementing firewalls, virtual LANs (VLANs), and access controls to enforce these strategies effectively.",

      "summary": "Isolation is a cybersecurity strategy that restricts compromised assets or applications from causing further damage to the network by limiting their access to resources. This is achieved through techniques like process isolation, which ensures that a compromised process can only affect its own resources, thereby protecting other processes and the overall system. As a preventative security measure, isolation is implemented proactively to enhance the stability and security of operating systems.",
