  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool. It is able to take a PCAP file and analyze it for clues about the hosts and protocols on the network at the time of the capture. To open NetworkMiner in Security Onion, go to Applications, Other and then NetworkMiner. Once it opens, go to file open and then choose the pcap file that you want to analyze. NetworkMiner will then automatically analyze the file and present the information in a series of tabs. The first tab is the hosts tab. This tab will list all of the unique hosts by IP addresses that were found in the PCAP file. Each host can be opened by clicking on the plus sign next to it revealing the information about the host that NetworkMiner knows. For example, if I open 172.28.24.3 I will get it's IP, MAC Address, information about the number of packets it sent and received, and any details about the host. In this case, if I click on the Host Details, I will see the User-Agent string of the browser the host used. In the next tab, you will find the files that were transferred between hosts during the packet capture. Right-clicking on a file will allow you to open the file or calculate the file's hash. For this capture, I created a fake virus using the EICAR test string. This string when placed in a file will be detected as a virus by most vendors. I can choose to open the folder where the virus.exe is stored and then open it using gedit to show the EICAR string. I can also use the file hash feature to compare the file to known bad file hashes using tools like VirusTotal. First right-click on the file and choose Calculate MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hash. Next highlight the hash you want to compare and press CTRL+C to copy it to the clipboard. In a web browser, open VirusTotal.com and click on the Search link. Then paste the hash into the search box and press enter. This will then compare the hash against known malicious files. In this case, it will be an EICAR test file that most antivirus manufacturers will mark as a virus. Another tab of interest is the credentials tab. Here any clear text credentials like telnet, FTP, or HTTP will be shown. In this capture, there was an FTP session that we have the credentials for. The sessions tab shows the unique conversations between hosts. Any DNS queries and responses that are captured will be decoded in the DNS tab. The parameters tab shows many potential key-value pairs that may have important information. Finally, NetworkMiner provides the ability to search a PCAP file for certain keywords. You can do this by clicking on Keywords. Next add a keyword and follow the instruction to reload the case file. The display will now show all of the packets that include the keyword. That's it for this demo. In this demo we used NetworMiner to view the contents of a captured PCAP file.",
