We'll also talk about using netflow/sflow echo and Ipfix. Let's get started. Bandwidth monitors are a type of application that help network admins understand bandwidth usage. The first order of business with these applications is to establish a baseline. The longer a monitor runs, the more data points are created. When a substantial number of data points are created, a normal usage becomes apparent. Normal bandwidth usage is relative and varies by hours in the day, days of the week, and even weeks within the year. A baseline provides something concrete to compare against current usage or even suspect bandwidth usage. There are many bandwidth monitoring applications available. There are cloud-based apps, on-premise apps, open source, and paid. Each one looks and functions differently, but each has the same goal, which is to allow easy access to bandwidth monitoring. The key is to learn how to establish a monitoring schedule and how to use the dashboard. Here, we have some screenshots of different pages within a dashboard. As you can see, this graphic is showing bandwidth usage be the hour and below usage per day aggregated over time. This is the baseline that suspect usage is compared against. The second graphic shows the last hour's usage and the usage for a user-specified time frame. This allows for deeper examination of suspect bandwidth usage. Email is a great tool that almost everyone uses to communicate. It's also the avenue for the majority of malicious network breaches. Fortunately, email provides metadata so it can be traced. All emails come with a header that contains information about both the sender and recipient. Parts of the headers can be spoofed to give investigators false information. The good news is that there are security devices that put X-headers throughout an emails' headers. These provide the originating email account and IP address, not the spoofed one. Communications sent via mobile devices are common today. They come from tablets, laptops, smart phones, smart watches, and any other portable device that connects to the internet. These devices send emails and text messages and use apps to allow data and photo sharing. All this data produces metadata that can be used to identify people, places, times, and even deleted data. Pictures can be time stamped and geolocation stamped. Much of this metadata also reveals the origination of the data and the sender. Websites produce many types of metadata. In fact, the metadata on a user's machine versus the server can be very different. The data on the opposite side of the transmission can help fill in gaps and corroborate findings on the opposing machine. Metadata includes IP addresses, user requests, user downloads, time spent on the site, and even attempts to gain unauthorized access. Web metadata also includes cookies, browser history, and even cached pages. Many times, malicious actors will attempt to obfuscate their real metadata. But the good news is that there are ways of finding the real metadata, especially for trained forensic investigators. Files produce many types of metadata. The first kind is File Creation (date/time). The File Creation data is the first time the file was written to the storage media it's currently on. This means that the file can be created in a different place and then moved or copied to a new location. Last written refers to the last time a file was saved for any reason. It could prove that the file was copied from a different location or that the file was altered. Last access is any time a file is touched. When combined with file creation metadata on a user's machine, it can establish the probability that the file was copied from one machine to another. It also introduces the idea that a third device is involved in data copy process. Once the third device is found, it makes obtaining answers much easier. Network admins are always looking for a way to look at what's happening inside their network. Netflow is a session sampling protocol. This protocol works at Layers 2 through 4. It can exam each data flow that comes through or be set to sample sessions at certain intervals. If you want to sample packets in a broader layer range, then sFlow is your answer. This protocol works on Layers 2 through 7. Unlike Netflow, sFlow examines packets and can only be used in sampling mode. This is stateless packet sampling that provides information efficiently. IPFIX integrates data that normally goes to Syslog or SNMP information directly in the IPFIX packet, eliminating thee additional services collecting data from each network device. IPFIX has provisions for fields that are variable-length, meaning no ID number restrictions. It came about because of the need for a standardized protocol for internal protocol flows. This data comes from routers, servers, and other network appliances that are mediation systems. The data is formatted and sent to an exporter and then on to a collector. IPFIX, like NetFlow, looks at flow and the number of packets being sent and received during a given session. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we talked about the different ways metadata is produced. We covered some of the pitfalls of metadata as well as some of the ways to overcome them. And we discussed creating a baseline using network bandwidth monitors. These monitors can alert us to abnormal activity on our network.",
