The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. The incident response lifecycle provides a structured approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. The incident response lifecycle includes seven steps: preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Part of the preparation step is to ensure that systems are resilient to attack. This includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and setting up confidential lines of communication. The preparation step also includes creating incident response resources and procedures. An Incident Response Plan is like a fire drill for cyber threats. Just as a fire drill outlines steps to evacuate a building safely, an Incident Response Plan contains instructions on how to react when a cyber-attack occurs. The detection step discovers indicators of threat actor activity. Indicators that an incident may have occurred could be generated from an automated intrusion system or other monitoring and alerting systems. Incidents can also be detected using threat hunting methods or by reports made by employees or customers. The containment phase is where immediate action is taken to prevent further damage or compromise of the system. This could involve disconnecting affected systems or devices from the network to prevent the spread of the breach. It's the equivalent of stopping the bleeding in a medical emergency, a quick and temporary fix to halt the immediate threat. Containment strategies can vary based on the severity and nature of the incident. After containment, an in-depth investigation leads to the next phase—eradication. Next is the recovery phase. During this phase, systems and networks are returned to their normal function. All systems affected by the cyberattack are cleaned, restored, and put back into operation. Recovery may involve reinstalling system components, changing passwords, and patching software. System administrators should carefully monitor systems during recovery for any signs of abnormal activity, as this could indicate that not all threat elements have been successfully eradicated. Regular operations can resume once the systems are deemed secure and functioning normally. The recovery phase isn't considered complete until all systems are back operational and all data has been recovered. The last phase in the incident response lifecycle is the \"lessons learned\" stage. During this phase, the incident response team conducts a post-incident review. This review aims to identify what went well during the response, what could've been done better, and what improvements can be made to the incident response process. It provides an opportunity to learn from the incident and improve future response efforts. The lessons learned may include changes to policies, procedures, or infrastructure. They may lead to further security and awareness training for employees. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we've discussed incident response. We looked at the seven steps of the incident response lifecycle: preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.",
