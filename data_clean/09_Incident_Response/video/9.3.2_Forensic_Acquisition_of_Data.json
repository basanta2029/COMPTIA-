We will also discuss the order in which the evidence needs to be gathered. The process of capturing volatile data follows the order of volatility. We need to preserve the most volatile data first and work our way down to data that is more persistent. If an attack is underway, your computer forensics response team is probably going to capture volatile data before trying to gather data from the hard disk or turning the system off. The order of volatility is: RAM, Swap Files/PageFiles, Hard Drive, Remote Logs, Archived Data. These items must be investigated in this order so that potential evidence is not lost. Each one of these items has its own challenges and potential dangers when acquiring forensic data. Let's look at tools and approaches to acquire and retain data from these items. In a computer forensics investigation, the data on the hard disk drive is a key piece of evidence. A lot of the things that we do on a computer system are saved in some way on the hard disk drive, including virtual memory. A wealth of data is there. In addition, information attached to deleted files may still be on the disk. Therefore, the hard drive itself is a goldmine of evidence for a prosecutor. Caution must be exercised when making a copy of the hard drive. A regular file-for-file copy is not good enough. It needs to be a sector-by-sector copy that includes data formerly deleted but still accessible. RAM is the most volatile of all computer data storage. RAM is cleared when a computer is shutdown. Once gone, it cannot be recovered. Data in RAM can be copied as long as the system is running, but should be done only by someone with proper training. The data stored in RAM can have valuable information. Many times malware like worms, viruses and trojan horses are created as memory-resident only. This makes catching them difficult. Swap files, or page files, are a virtual extension of RAM. An OS is designed so that if you are running low on RAM it can place not-in-use information into the swap or page file on the hard drive to be used later. An admin can determine how much space to allocate to page files. For the forensic investigator, this is another potential source of evidence. The page file data does not automatically delete at shutdown unless you change the default settings. The OS is a virtual treasure trove of evidence. File systems like NTFS and Ext4 are the roadmap to where data is stored. There is also a registry which is a database that stores information about all the applications installed on a computer. Registry keys are folder-like objects that store application-specific information for each application stored in the registry. The recycle bin is where deleted files are placed. Also the print spooler can be examined to see the print history from a computer. In the last 30 years technology devices have changed dramatically. With the increase of digital devices there is an equal increase in devices that may require forensic examination. These devices contain all the evidence a forensic investigator needs. Each device, such as smart phone, tablet, laptop and smart watch all share common elements, namely RAM, CPU, logs and storage space. A trained investigator must be familiar with all platforms. Firmware is the basic level of software that controls some hardware. Firmware is stored in read-only, persistent memory. This non-volatile memory does not self-delete and in many cases is not updated. Firmware has become vulnerable to different attacks like rootkits and even steganography. The hard drive has firmware that can be manipulated by malicious actors. Extracting this data is difficult and requires specialized training and expensive tools. A snapshot can be a useful tool in capturing the exact state of running systems. Snapshots capture volatile data in an ever-changing environment. This tool is not a substitute for the sector-by-sector copy of a disk. The snapshots can be saved for future examination. Snapshots are valuable only if taken of a running system that is currently experiencing an attack. A cache is stored data that is used to improve the speed of the computing process. There are different caches in a computer system. Address resolution protocol, or ARP, matches IP with MAC addresses. This protocol has a built-in caching component that saves CPU time and network bandwidth by referring to the cache. Internet browser history is also cached and can provide valuable evidence regarding search history. Network forensic data plays an important role in an investigation. Network appliances that are important in an investigation are firewall, router, switches, domain controllers, DHCP servers, application servers and web proxy servers. There are also applications on the network including intrusion detection and intrusion protection systems. In computer forensics an artifact is an object that contains forensic value. Forensic value is evidence found on hardware or in areas like registry hives that show indicators of compromise. These indicators are a digital sign of a breach. It is important to preserve these artifacts and understand their value to a forensic investigation. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we learned the procedure used to prioritize evidence gathering called the order of volatility. We discussed different areas within a network that contain potential evidence such as cache, network appliance, OS, disks and RAM. We also covered artifacts and how they are defined and identified.",
