In our scenario, we need to examine a hard drive from a malicious employee's workstation. Before you try this for real, make sure that your organization considers you qualified to do this and that you have the backing of your legal department. The first thing we need to do is create an image of the employee's hard drive. Like I said, we're going to use the FTK Imager to do this. Remember, when we're conducting a forensic investigation, we don't want to modify the evidence in any way, shape, or form. If this situation were to be litigated for some reason—\"say, the employee gets fired and then sues the company--then the prosecutor could say that when we conducted our forensic investigation, we planted the evidence on the hard drive. That's why it's crucial to make sure that that hard drive isn't changed in any way during the forensics investigation. We're going to create an image of that hard drive, and we're going to do all of our testing, examining, and investigative work on the imaged copy of the hard drive, not on the actual hard drive. Once we've created that image, we'll use a second tool to analyze the contents of the hard drive to see if we can find anything that's questionable. The first thing we need to do is get an image of the hard drive. To do this, we have to connect the hard drive to this forensic workstation. That's problematic because as soon as you connect a hard drive to a Windows workstation, Windows immediately starts writing little bits of data to the drive—\"but we don't want to modify the drive in any way. So we can't just directly connect the drive to a SATA connector on this workstation. Instead, we need to implement a write blocker, also known as a forensic disk controller. Its job is to block writing to the hard drive. It allows us to connect the employee's hard drive to the write blocker, and then we connect the write blocker to our machine, usually with a USB cable. This prevents any write operations coming from the operating system on the forensic computer from going through to the device that we're analyzing. So remember, when you're conducting a forensic investigation on a hard drive and you're going create an image, always use a write blocker to prevent any type of write operation from occurring on that drive. I've already set this system up with a write blocker, and it's ready to go. Let's go ahead and use the FTK Imager to create an image that we can analyze. By the way, FTK Imager is a free tool. A lot of the forensic software is very, very expensive, but you don't have to spend a lot of money to be able to conduct a good forensic investigation. There are a lot of free, open source, and legitimate tools for forensic investigations. Within Access Manager, let's click on Add Evidence Item. Then we have to specify what we're going to add. We're adding a physical drive because I've connected it to a write blocker on this particular system. Click Next. We have to specify which drive we want to create the image from. You'll notice, when I click the dropdown list, it picked all of the hard drives on this system. You need to be very careful that you don't choose the wrong one. For example, if I were to choose Physical Drive 0, that's my local workstation hard disk drive. We'd be creating an image of my local system, not the actual drive that's being used for evidence. Physical Drive 1 is the drive that I've connected to the write blocker. That's what we want to choose. I'll click Finish. We'll come over here, to the Physical Drive 1, and we'll right-click on it. We want to Export Disk Image. Under Image Destination, we'll click Add. Then we can specify which type of destination image we want to create. Raw (dd) is the default selection because it's probably one of the most widely used imaging format for forensics, so we'll just leave it set the way it is. Click Next. We need to document the evidence. Remember, whenever you're conducting a forensic investigation, you need to document everything. In fact, you should take a picture of the entire setup that you're using to analyze this hard disk drive. You should take a picture of the drive, take a picture of how it's connected to the write blocker, and take another picture of how the write blocker is connected to the computer. You might even want to take a video of the entire process. Under Evidence Item Information, you'll want to assign a case number. Let's do —˜1 2 3 4' and evidence number —˜5 6 7 8'. Then we'll give it a unique description. We'll enter —˜HD from Mary Worley.' I'll put —˜Dana Fellows' down as the examiner. Click Next. We have to specify where we want to store the image file on my computer. I have a folder for my forensic images. Let's create a new folder, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'. I'll put in the same thing here for Image Filename, —˜1 2 3 4 Mary Worley'. If we want to, we can fragment the image--that is, break the image file into multiple pieces. This is a small hard drive. I'm going to set that to zero, which basically means we'll have one image file for the entire hard disk. Click Finish. We want to make sure that Verify the images after they are created is checked. It's also a good idea to create a directory listing of all the files and the image after they're created, so check that box too. It can be useful for when you're searching for information. Click Start. At this point, the imaging process has started. It'll take a little bit of time to complete, especially if you're going to be working with a big hard disk drive. I'm going to pause the recording now and come back when it's done. Okay. As you can see, it's almost done verifying the image. In just a few seconds, the process will be complete. Notice that it's created two different hashes, an MD5 Hash and a SHA1 Hash. For both of these, the hashes match. The MD5 Hash matched, and the SHA1 Hash matched as well. That's good. That's exactly what we want to see. I'll go ahead and hit Close. Before we end this demo, let's verify that the image file has been created. I'll open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where we saved the image. Here are the various pieces of information that were pulled from the hard drive to create it. We have the image file itself. There's a CSV document that contains a listing of all the filenames and directory names. Last on the list, we have a document that provides a nice summary of the image creation process. It gives us the case number, our evidence number, the description, the examiner, all the information we filled out earlier, and the information about the hard drive itself from Mary Worley's computer. At this point, our image file is created. The next step of the process is to use another tool, such as Autopsy, to examine the image. That's all for this demo. We used FTK imager to capture a forensic image of a hard drive. We discussed the importance of using a write blocker to keep data from getting tampered with and the importance of examining a copy of the disk, not the original disk itself. Then we made a copy the image and verified that it was saved to the folder we created.",
