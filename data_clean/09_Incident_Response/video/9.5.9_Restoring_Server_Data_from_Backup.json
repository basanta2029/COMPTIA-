In our File Explorer window, let's navigate to the Desktop, where we can find the Shares folder that we previously created. Now, let's delete this folder, making it disappear. However, imagine that later on, we realize we need it back. To retrieve it, we'll have to restore it from a backup. To initiate this process, let's go to Tools &gt; Windows Server Backup. In the Messages Box, we can see the available backup options. Let's click on the one we want to use and review its information. Once we're satisfied, click OK. Next, we'll click on \"Recover\" and then proceed with \"Next.\" Here, we can verify our selection to ensure it's the correct backup. Since it's the only one available, let's proceed by clicking \"Next.\" Note that we have several recovery options. We can recover files or folders, and if this were a Hyper-V Server, we could recover an entire virtual machine if needed. It's also possible to recover entire volumes. Now, let's talk about applications recovery. If you have backed up a server with installed applications like Exchange or SharePoint, you can restore the entire application without having to reinstall it from scratch. However, you only need to recover the data in this case. This can be useful for transferring an application from one server to another using the backup. The last option is to recover specific files and folders. Let's click \"Next.\" So, we'll navigate to the specific folder we want to recover. After selecting it, click \"Next,\" and then choose to restore it to the original location. Although you have the option to save it elsewhere, we want it back in its original place. Now, let's create copies of both versions just as a precautionary measure. There are several reasons not to overwrite existing versions. If you're restoring a file that someone claims is missing, and they provide the wrong filename, you could accidentally overwrite a file they intended to keep. This could lead to future problems. It's a wise practice to create copies to avoid data loss or accidental overwrites. In such cases, you'd have to go back and recover even more data. Let's proceed by selecting \"Next\" and then \"Recover.\" Now, it confirms that the process is complete. Let's close and minimize the windows. You can now see that the folder has been successfully restored to its original location. In this demonstration, we walked you through the process of restoring data using Windows Server 2022 Backup, illustrating how to utilize Windows Restore Data effectively.",
