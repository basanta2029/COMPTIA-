The first thing we need to do is go to Manage, click Add Roles and Features. Now we're going to just select Default, Next, Next, past everything until we get to features. Then we're going to scroll down and go to Windows Server Backup. Select it, click next. On the confirm window I can click Install. Then that's going to go ahead and install and that may take a few minutes. Once that's installed, we can go to our tools all the way down, scroll down to Windows Server Backup. Using Windows Server Backup you can schedule regular server backups, or you can schedule a single backup. In this case, we're going to just choose Backup Once. However, a good disaster recovery program would do regular backups. We'll click backup once since were not scheduling a backup. Since we have not created any scheduled backups before, you must click different options. Let's go ahead and click Custom. Click Next, we're going to click add items and we're going to select the System State. Bare Metal Recovery, will backup all the critical volumes on the computer. It will backup the operating system and all the data volumes if you are doing a bare metal recovery, also sometimes known as an all critical backup, the backup can't be saved on any of the volumes that are being backed up. As well with the system state backup, we can't save the backup on the C drive because that's where the system state exists. So the system state includes the registry key files, Active Directory and the SYSVOL. We need to have some other place to store this backup. I've connected an external drive to this system currently, so I'm going to click OK. Click next and you actually also have the ability to save things to remote share folders. If you have some shared storage on your network, you could actually go save your backup there. We're going to select a local drive since it's a drive I have plugged into this local machine. It's my F drive labeled Backup. We're going to click Next, and Backup. Okay, so once this backup finishes, which it will take a while, we'll have a good backup of our active directory and the SYSVOL. If we need to restore, we can come back to this backup later to restore the main domain controller. In this demonstration we installed Windows server backup on your Windows Server and then backed up our domain controller.",

      "summary": "The Windows Server Backup tool allows users to schedule regular or one-time backups of critical system components, including the operating system and data volumes, essential for disaster recovery. A bare metal recovery captures all vital elements, including the system state, which encompasses registry files and Active Directory, and must be stored on a different volume than the one being backed up. Users can save backups to local drives or remote share folders, ensuring data integrity and availability for future restoration needs.",
