We'll use Kibana to review sample logs. Security Onion is a free and open source Linux distribution for threat hunting, enterprise security monitoring, and log management. It includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Snort, Suricata, Zeek (formerly known as Bro), Wazuh, Sguil, Squert, CyberChef, NetworkMiner, and many other security tools. First, we click the Kibana link on the Security Onion desktop. By default, Security Onion uses a self-signed TLS certificate. We tell Chromium to allow us to proceed by clicking Advanced and then proceed. On a production system, it would be advisable to install a valid TLS certificate and use the fully qualified name instead of localhost. The username and password for Security Onion are set during the initial setup. In this case, we set up a user in the Security Operations Center (SOC). We'll login as that user. After logging in, Kibana defaults to the dashboard page. This could be used as a dashboard for a SOC or as the starting point for a threat hunter. In this case, we want to look at the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) logs, so we click NIDS to drill down. Here we notice a classification of Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain that we want to look at further. To do that, we hover on that line and click the magnifying glass with the plus sign. This adds it as a filter. To keep the filter as we pivot to other parts of Kibana, we click Actions and pin the filter. Next, we click Discover to see the logs that match the filter. Notice how the filter has stayed with us because we pinned it. Now we can see each log entry that matched our filter. Notice that the timestamp and other information about the alert is listed. You can view more information for an event by clicking the arrow to the left of the time stamp. From the description, we can also search for more information about the signature listed. We do this by highlighting it, right-clicking, and choosing to search for it using Google. Some signatures are based on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). CVEs describe potential security issues with certain software or hardware. They provide a common language to evaluate the risk posed. By typing CVE into the search field, you can focus the results on signatures that are tied to a CVE. Researching the CVE can help you determine whether the attempt against the asset could be successful. Let's look at one more example. But first, let's clear our pinned criteria by going to Actions and clicking Remove. We also need to remove the search term CVE. Once this is done, we'll go back to the dashboard. Under Zeek Hunting, click HTTP to list alerts relating only to the HTTP protocol. Now we can look at the events based on the HTTP status messages and the methods used. Using the same technique with the magnifying glass as before, let's drill into the Forbidden messages. Again, we want to pin the filter so that it stays with us as we move through Kibana. Notice that this time we are using a different way to pin the filter. This method allows you to pin or unpin individual filters instead of all filters. In the details of one of the events, we can see the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that the attacker tried to access. We can also see the user agent of the attacker. In this case, our attacker didn't mask the fact that a common tool for finding website vulnerabilities called Nikto was being used. That's it for this demo. In this demo we went over a few of the ways the power of Elasticsearch can be harnessed to help the security professional.",
