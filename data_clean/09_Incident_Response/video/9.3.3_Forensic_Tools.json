  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script In this lesson, we're going to discuss some of the forensic tools on the market. Some of the tools are Linux-specific, and other others are Windows-centric. Investigating and gathering evidence for court action is part of handling computer security. These computer forensic investigations require specialized tools to gather evidence without making changes to the devices or their stored data. These tools include imaging software, data extraction tools, and advanced search capabilities. Let's take a look at three of these tools and how they work. We're going to talk about dd-CLI, Memdump, and WinHex. The first tool, dd, is an extraction tool. It's one of the oldest forensic tools still in use. It's used in Linux and Unix systems to create bit-by-bit copies of a physical hard drive without mounting the drive beforehand. It uses the dd-CLI command, and it's easy to employ. A raw image is created for forensic analysis, and the user has multiple file extension choices. Memdump is another data gathering tool. It aggregates the data in the volatile RAM memory from devices. Normally, a second tool is needed to search through all the data in a memdump file. WinHex is a powerful disk and universal hexadecimal editor. It's used in digital forensics for data recovery. WinHex is Windows-compatible and can be used with a whole bunch of options, making it a very versatile forensic tool. Now let's move on to imaging tools. Imaging tools must create exact copies of data without making a single change—not even one bit. FTK Imager is a powerful tool that allows the investigator to acquire, preview, and copy data thoroughly and forensically. Autopsy is exactly what it sounds like—a forensic tool that investigators use to thoroughly examine extracted data, pictures, and empty disk space in order to determine exactly what happened. And that's it for this lesson. We talked about Forensics tools and how they fall within a few categories; data gathering, imaging, and extraction. We discussed what forensic tools must be able to do--create an exact image of a disk with perfect integrity and then search large amounts of data for specific file extensions, hidden files, deleted data, and root cause analysis.",
