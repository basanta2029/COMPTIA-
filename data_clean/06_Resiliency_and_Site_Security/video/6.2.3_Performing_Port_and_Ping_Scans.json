We've downloaded and installed Zenmap for Windows. Even though Zenmap has a graphical user interface, we still use the familiar commands that Nmap uses. Other than that, the interface is quite simple. First, you want to identify the target of your scan. In this case, it might be 192.168.2.1, a specific IP address, or maybe a range of IP addresses using CIDR notation. It's going to make sure that these first three octets stay the same, 192.168.2, then we'll try .1 and so on all the way up to .255 for the last octet. To the right here, you can see what type of scan you want to perform. Right now, it's listed as an intense scan. To start out, I'm going do a lighter scan. You can see you have Intense Scan, plus UDP, plus all the TCP ports, without the ping, etc. You have the ping, the quick scan, the quick scan plus, and on and on. There's lots of different options here. I'm going to start out with just a ping scan, which will simply see if the hosts in this IP address range respond to a ping. To do this, I'll simply select that option and then click on Scan. This will only take a few seconds to complete, as it's a very lightweight scan. You'll see here, as it goes on, that we'll start to populate the operating systems and the hosts associated with those IP addresses to the left. In this case, we haven't done a deep scan. We don't know the operating systems on these hosts or other details yet. But we can see all the hosts that are in that range that responded to the ping scan. Maybe we come down and say, \"Hey, this IP address is something of interest.\" Then we can go and do an intense scan with that specific host. Before I do that, let me show you here that there's not really a lot we know about this host right now. We know its MAC address, its IP address, and whether it's currently up, but we don't know anything else. You could do this intense scan with a full range of IP addresses. It'll just take a while. In the interest of time, I'll just do an intense scan on that single IP address. This takes about four or five minutes to complete depending on the responsiveness of the server, so I'll stop the demo while it runs. But you can see that it's starting to discover open ports, different TCP ports, and it'll run through a variety of different scripts to try to discover information about this host. When all is said and done, we should be able to see what type of operating system it is, even the version of the operating system, and other things that it uses as it discovers open ports. It can query those ports and ask certain questions in order to receive responses and determine the types of services that are running on this machine. We'll go ahead and pause now until that script is complete. You can see that it's completed the scan. Let's look through some of these results first. We'll start at the top. It scanned for specific ports, and it started a service scan and gathered some information. It was looking for 20 specific services. It took about a minute to do that. Then it tried to detect the operating system and a variety of other services. It looks at the specific ports and tries to determine which programs are actually running. This server has DNS server. It's actually Microsoft's DNS server. Because of the types of queries that Nmap puts out, you can see the types of services that are actually running. We know that it's Microsoft DNS. We know Microsoft IIS, the web server, is running there, and we know the version of that web server and a variety of other services that are currently running. Some remote procedure calls on certain ports that are open, and a variety of other information like the net BIOS names and the server versions. We can get quite a bit of detail using Nmap and the associated GUI. Let's click on 15. You can see that we have a summary of information for that. It's Windows, and it has the last boot time. It was back on May 9th. That's several months ago. Then we have the versions and other information. This is a great tool that you can use to quickly gather information about a network. It's easy to see why these tools make it so easy to attack and hack, or at least understand the composition of the machines within a network. All right, that's it for this demo--just a quick demo of Nmap and the associated Zenmap GUI and how you can do ping scans and port scans using this tool.",
