To assist network defenders in this task, we can implement network intrusion detection or network intrusion prevention systems. In this lesson, we'll look at the differences, detection methods, and implementation of these systems. To better understand the differences between an intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system, lets take a look at what each of them do. An intrusion detection system, or IDS, is used to monitor and detect unauthorized access. It doesn't try to stop an attack or prevent traffic; it just monitors data packets and creates logs. An IDS can be either a software program or a hardware device. Similar to an IDS is an intrusion prevention system, or IPS. Not only does the IPS monitor network traffic, it also works to block unauthorized and suspicious packets from entering the network. No solution is perfect, and that's why we should always implement security-in-depth and use both detection and prevention systems. Even with an IPS, malicious packets may still find their way into the network. The IDS can serve as a backup and alert us that something suspicious may be going on and record it for us. This information will be extremely valuable after the attack so that we can figure out exactly what happened and what the damage is. Now that we understand what an IDS and IPS are, lets take a look at how they work. Both IDS and IPS systems monitor data packets for suspicious traffic. They do vary slightly in how they accomplish this, but both systems use generally the same methods. For simplicity's sake we'll talk about the IDS systems, but understand that all of this can apply to both unless otherwise specified. This first and most common method is signature-based detection. This type of IDS is sometimes called a misuse-detection IDS. It attempts to match the known traffic patterns of specific network attacks. Similar to how viruses have a unique fingerprint that antivirus programs use to detect them, malicious packets also have a unique fingerprint that the IDS can use to identify them with. The other detection method is heuristic, or behavior-based detection, sometimes referred to as statistical anomaly-based detection. With this type of detection, you set up a baseline of regular network activity and the IDS determines if activity is outside the norm. The biggest issue with this method is that a larger number of false positives are likely to be generated. No matter the detection method being used, an IDS can either be a host-based or network-based IDS. A host-based IDS is software installed on the host system. Host-based IDSs are better at detecting attacks unique to the services and applications on that system than network-based IDSs. A host-based IDS also monitors local files for suspicious activity, which is something a network-based IDS can't do. The problem with host-based IDSs is that software must be installed on each system you want to protect. This can lead to excessive administrative effort. Also, if a system is compromised, the log reports on that system become unreliable because the attacker may have modified the log files. The other option is to install the IDS on the network itself. This is a physical device that monitors network traffic in real time. We have two options on where to install a network IDS: inline or out of band. Because an IDS is a passive device that simply monitors packets, they're generally installed as out-of-band devices. All this means is that the device is installed outside the flow of traffic. It's usually connected with a network tap, like a switch, which allows it to monitor traffic without being in the way. An IPS on the other hand is an active device that's usually installed inline, or in the flow of traffic. All data goes through the IPS, where it's checked out and either allowed to pass through or stopped. Regardless of whether the device is inline or out of band, it can be installed in front of or behind the firewall. Generally, an IDS or IPS should be installed behind the firewall as this uses less resources. That'll wrap things up for this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems. The biggest difference between the two is that an IDS is a passive monitoring device and an IPS is an active prevention device. We also looked at the common detection methods that both use, which are signature-based detection and heuristic, or behavior-based, detection. Finally, we looked at how to install these devices on a network. IDSs should be installed out of band and IPSs should be inline.",
