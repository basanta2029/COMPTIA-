In most cases, you'll see these tools as software programs that run a computer system, but there are hardware analyzers available as well. Be aware that protocol analyzers are also called packet analyzers, packet sniffers, network analyzers, network sniffers, or network scanners. These terms all mean roughly the same thing. Some of the more common protocol analyzers are Wireshark, tcpdump, Cain and Abel, and WinDump. In this lesson, I'll go over how these analyzers work and what we use them for. The most common way to set up a protocol analyzer is to install the program on a computer that's connected to a network switch. This can be a desktop computer, but laptops are also useful as they provide greater mobility. When we use a protocol analyzer, the computer's network interface card, or NIC, must be placed in promiscuous mode. Promiscuous mode means that the NIC is able to see all packets on the same network segment. In non-promiscuous mode, the NIC only receives packets that are addressed to its MAC address. Once we set up and configure our computer with the protocol analyzer, we can begin monitoring the packets that run across the network. We can usually just sit back and monitor the data without much interaction. This is known as passive interception. Once we actually begin capturing packets, there's quite a few things we can do with this data. Depending on what we're trying to accomplish, there are different ways we can take advantage of the protocol analyzer's features. For example, a network administrator may use their protocol analyzer to look for specific protocols like SMTP, DNS, POP3, or ICMP that have packets running across the network. The administrator could even detect an employee's unauthorized internet use by scanning URLs that they find in these packets. The network SecOps team could use their packet analyzer during a vulnerability assessment. This could reveal open ports or whether passwords are being sent in cleartext or not. They could also detect any malformed or fragmented packets, which would indicate that someone is trying to get around the firewall. Malicious users can also use a protocol analyzer for many of these same purposes. They could use it to fingerprint a system, which means determining which operating system is running based on how the system responds to different types of network traffic. Malicious users can also use protocol analyzers to perform active interception. This is when the user intercepts data in order to perform attacks or session hijacking. MAC flooding is another issue for you to be aware of. A bad actor can connect to a switch and, in short, overload it with fake MAC addresses. MAC flooding essentially turns the switch into a hub and allows the hacker to see all passing traffic. Most times, though, protocol analyzers are used for valid purposes. Just be aware that unscrupulous people sometimes use them to get around security systems. That'll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at protocol analyzers and how they work. We also went over protocol analyzers' many uses and misuses, and we saw how you can utilize this tool for your role in system security. Always remember to put the NIC in promiscuous mode to properly capture data when choosing to use a protocol analyzer.",
