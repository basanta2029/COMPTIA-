There are two types of reconnaissance, passive and active. Passive reconnaissance is gathering information without directly interacting with users, and active reconnaissance is gathering information through direct interaction with users. In this lesson, we'll look at the tools associated with both types. Before interacting with a target, a hacker should perform passive reconnaissance to gather as much information as possible without alerting the anyone. Gathering information through packet sniffing, eavesdropping, and Open-source intelligence, or OSINT, are the more common passive methods. Packet sniffing is capturing data packets and analyzing them for useful information. If you're in a public place, you can gather these data packets and use a tool like Wireshark to see if you can find anything useful. Because you're not sending any data, you're essentially a bystander, so this is a passive reconnaissance method. You need to scan for open wireless networks before you can start sniffing packets. Two common scanning methods are war driving and war flying. War driving is driving or walking around with a wireless device to look for open vulnerable wireless networks. War flying is the doing the same thing using a drone or another unmanned aerial vehicle. Eavesdropping is another way you can passively gather information. It can include listening to employee conversations, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving. People often throw out documents with sensitive information and don't realize it. Holding your nose and sifting through dirty garbage doesn't require any special skills or tools. It's a really easy way for any hacker to get get really valuable information. Open-source intelligence, or OSINT, is any data collected from publicly available sources. This includes doing web searches on search engines like Google, social media sites such as LinkedIn, and other sources to gather personal identifiable information, or PII. After a hacker has gained as much information as possible using passive reconnaissance, they'll move on to active reconnaissance. Active reconnaissance is the process of gathering information by interacting with the target. Because you are directly interacting with the target, you can be discovered. During this phase, hackers gather additional information that they couldn't get with passive reconnaissance. This includes network information such as IP addresses, sub-domains, and DNS information. They'll also gather system information such as operating systems, users and passwords, locations of servers, and organizational information that wasn't gathered during passive reconnaissance. Doing all of this reconnaissance provides a wealth of knowledge on the target. The goal is to understand the target's security, narrow focus for potential attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and create a network map. Sometimes the line between passive and active reconnaissance can get blurry. Just always remember that and any amount of direct interaction means you're using an active method. There's a wealth of tools and resources hackers and penetration tester can use to gather all of this information. One of the first tools a security professional should use in reconnaissance is the OSINT framework. This framework is a collection of resources and tools that are separated by common categories to easily gather all sorts of online information, making the initial reconnaissance process much easier. theHarvester is a great passive reconnaissance tool that can gather lots of information from public sources, such as search engines, social media sites, and Shodan. There are some options in the program to brute force DNS information, which is active reconnaissance. Shodan is a very popular search engine for internet-connected devices. Users can search for specific types of devices and locations. You can use this information to see if a target has any online devices without proper security and gather more information about them. Dnsenum is a program that finds all DNS servers and entries for an organization. This helps you find information such as usernames, computer names, IP addresses, and more. Depending on the settings used, dnsenum can be either passive or active. Curl and wget are two programs that let you download and upload files. You can use them in the active reconnaissance phase to download an entire website and view its code and resources offline. Because you're actively interacting with the target, these are active reconnaissance tools. Scanless is a really cool tool for port scanning. It uses exploitation websites to perform port scans on your behalf. This means that you can scan your target anonymously. Even though you're not directly interacting with the target, this's still considered active reconnaissance. Sn1per is a scanning tool that combines many tools into one program. You can use Sn1per to find all sorts of information, such as DNS, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. This is definitely an active reconnaissance program. Finally, we have Nessus. Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable. You can use Nessus to scan your target for known vulnerabilities that you can exploit to gain access to the target. Nessus has many different options available for scanning, which allows you to narrow your focus. Using these tools allows you to gather all the information you could want about a person or organization. Network defenders can also use these same tools to discover what information is available to others and take necessary steps to remove or hide anything that shouldn't be accessed. And that wraps up this lesson. In this video, we compared passive and active reconnaissance techniques. Passive means there is no direct interaction with users, and active means there is direct interaction. We also reviewed some the common tools used in the reconnaissance phase.",
