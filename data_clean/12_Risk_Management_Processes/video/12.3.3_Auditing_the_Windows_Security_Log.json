There are two methods for auditing: You can audit individual workstations using the local security policy. However, this method can be time-intensive and challenging to manage when auditing more than a few hosts. Alternatively, you can use Group Policy, which we'll opt for as it's associated with the entire Windows domain. This is the method we'll demonstrate, as it's a more efficient solution. When a domain user logs in at a workstation, the audit settings for the Windows Security log will be applied to that workstation. Let's open Group Policy Management. This is our default domain, and here we have the Default Domain policy. We'll right-click and go to Edit. Now, we have a Group Policy Management Editor, which we'll expand. We'll navigate to Computer Configuration, Policies, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, and Audit Policy. On the right pane, you'll see audit policies, a total of nine. For instance, if we explore Audit Account Management, we can specify auditing the management of user and group accounts, or we can audit directory service access and various other events. Object Access allows us to audit access to files, folders, printers, registry keys, and more. We also have Audit Policy Change, which audits changes made to local policies, including user rights or security options. Audit Privilege Use lets us audit the use of user rights or privileges. Audit Process Tracking, primarily used by application developers, tracks detailed program information for events like program activation, process, exit, handle duplication, etc. It's resource-intensive, so use it sparingly. Lastly, we have Audit System Events, which logs system events such as server reboots, providing valuable information. Among the more useful audits from a security perspective are Audit Account Logon and Audit Logon Events. By default, these policies are undefined. Let's configure some Audit Logon Event policy settings. Let's open this up. We can audit for both success and failure, depending on your preferences and security needs. For example, auditing failed logon attempts can help identify potential security threats like password guessing attacks. On the other hand, auditing successful logins can be useful when investigating unauthorized access. For our demonstration, we'll audit logon failure events by selecting Failure and deselecting Success. Now, let's close the Group Policy Management Editor. The Default Domain policy is linked to the domain. To apply these settings, we need to generate some failed logon attempts and analyze them using Event Viewer. We've restarted this machine to update the Group Policy settings. Instead of rebooting, you can also use the Search box and type \"GPupdate\" to update Group Policy. Before logging back in, we intentionally created some failed password attempts. Let's examine the results. In Event Viewer, right-click and run as an administrator, expand Windows logs, and go to Security. We can see that our policy in the Default Domain has generated several audit failures due to the failed logon attempts. We can view details such as the account name that attempted to log in with a bad password. By navigating through the logs, we can inspect these failed attempts. Now, let's close this window. Before concluding this demonstration, let's explore one more feature. Under Group Policy Management, we'll return to the Default Domain, Edit, Group Policy Management Editor, and go to Computer Configuration, Windows settings. We'll expand and go to Security Settings, Local Policies, and Audit Policies. While the basic audit policies offer settings for broader behaviors, advanced audit policies allow for more granular control over auditing specific security events. For instance, we can configure audit policies for logon or logoff events. Under Security Settings, Advanced Audit Policy Configuration, and Audit Policies, we can target more specific audit events. Let's take Account Logon as an example. We can audit both success and failure of logon events. With the earlier audit settings, a single logon failure generated multiple messages in the Windows Security Log. By selecting specific audit options here, we can significantly reduce the volume of information generated, making it more manageable. These advanced audit policies also allow auditing for specific events like account lockouts, which isn't possible with the earlier policies. In summary, that's it for this demo. We discussed setting up auditing, configured logon auditing, generated and examined failed logon events in Event Viewer, and delved into the Advanced Audit Policy Configuration for more granular security event auditing.",
