Natural disasters can cause catastrophic failures or extended disruptions--anything from a lightning strike that fries a few hardware components to an earthquake that destroys the entire building. Business continuity planning is the creation and validation of a plan for recovering and restoring an organization's mission-critical functions after a catastrophic disaster or extended disruption. One important component of a business continuity plan is a business impact analysis, or BIA. A BIA focuses on the impact that losses will have on the organization. In a BIA, you identify critical functions--the operational functions that are necessary to conduct your business. Then you prioritize those critical business functions, calculate a timeframe for recovering them after a disaster, and estimate the tangible and intangible impact on the organization. When you're creating this plan, you'll want to consider several parameters. The first is the recovery time objective, or RTO. The RTO states how much down time your organization can tolerate. It's another way of asking how long it'll take to get your system back up and running in the event of a disaster. Some data protection solutions have a very short recovery time and can bring your network back into operation relatively quickly. Others have a long RTO that lasts several days. The second parameter is the recover point objective, or RPO. The RPO tells you two things. The first is the maximum length of time you can tolerate between backups. How old can restored data be? For example, if you run backups nightly, the maximum age of your data would be 24 hours because there would be a 24-hour window when no backups were taking place. If your organization only backs up data once a week, the maximum age of your data could be seven days. The longer the time between your backups, the older the data will be. In an extreme example, if you back up once a week on Sunday and have a catastrophic failure on Friday, all the work done for five or six days would be lost. Most organizations can't tolerate that. But if you run your backups once a day, the maximum age becomes 24 hours. That sounds much better than five or six days, right? The second thing RPO specifies is the number of backups from which to choose. Some disaster recovery solutions provide one backup. Other solutions may have multiple recovery points to select from. This depends on the data protection itself and how you've configured it. Another thing to consider during your business impact analysis is the mean time to repair. MTTR identifies the average amount of time needed to repair a failed component or to restore operations. If you provide system access to other organizations, your service level agreement may specify how quickly you guarantee a fully functional and accessible system. Similarly, the mean time between failures, or MTBF, identifies the average lifetime of a system or component--how long before the system wears out from age or use. Components should be replaced about the time the MTBF is reached. In the event of a tornado, fire, or hurricane, your building will probably be unusable. Implementing site resiliency – having an alternate location where you can pick up business where you left off – could be extremely beneficial to your organization. There are three categories of site resiliency: hot sites, warm sites, and cold sites. A hot site, or active backup model, is an alternate location that facilitates a fast and full recovery. This is, by far, the most effective backup option. It's also the most costly. In order to be fully operational within minutes, you need to have an alternate location. All servers, devices, cabling, and infrastructure need to be installed and ready to go. Hot sites often have a live connection to your main site with data copied across to the duplicate servers. This is called mirroring. If the active site fails, the hot site is fully operation immediately, with all the current data on the servers. This transition can occur within minutes or hours, so the downtime is minimal. A warm site is partially configured. You have an alternate location. Some servers, some devices, some cabling, and some infrastructure is installed, but not everything. Data backups are available, but they aren't mirrored. Some recovery from backup tapes, the cloud, or other backup locations may be needed. This transition could occur within hours or days, so the downtime would be noticeable. A warm site could be shared with another organization to lower its cost. This can be a good idea. Just make sure that the companies are in different areas so a natural disaster can't take them out at the same time. Finally, there's a cold site. You do have an alternate location, but all equipment would need to be installed, and all data would need to be recovered. Downtime could extend for several weeks or even months. No matter what type of site you decide to use, be sure to thoroughly document what you have and what you will need at the alternate location in the event of a disaster. That's it for this lesson. In this video, we discussed business continuity plans, business impact analysis, and site resiliency, including hot, warm, and cold site architecture.",
