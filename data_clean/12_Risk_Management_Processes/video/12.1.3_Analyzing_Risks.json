Risk analysis is the practice of determining which identified threats are most pressing to an organization and then attaching a potential cost that can be expected if that threat occurs. There are two general methods for analyzing and calculating risk. Quantitative analysis assigns real numbers to the costs of damages and countermeasures. It also assigns concrete probability percentages to risk occurrence. Qualitative analysis uses scenarios to identify risks and responses. Qualitative analysis is the more subjective of the two. When calculating quantitatively, you want to consider a risk's impact and likelihood. What kind of damage can be done, and what's the chance of it actually happening? To determine the likelihood of a loss, you might want to use an annualized rate of occurrence, or ARO. An ARO is a collection of data gathered from historical records such as crime statistics, natural disasters, insurance payouts, and cyber incidence records. To determine a loss's impact, you want to consider all associated costs if an unfortunate scenario were to occur. What would it cost to pay employees during the downtime? What would it cost to replace the impacted hardware or software? Would there be refunds or other costs associated with user retention? Single loss expectancy, or SLE, is the amount of loss expected for any single successful asset attack. This is a monetary value that describes how much the incident will cost in terms of lost asset value. Annual loss expectancy, or ALE, estimates the annual loss resulting from an incident. You calculate ALE by multiplying your SLE by your ARO. This tells you how much potential threats cost each year. For example, if your asset loses $1,000 for each incident, and you expect an incident every four years, the annual cost for that asset would be $250.00. Having a visual representation of risks can help stakeholders make better assessments. A risk register provides details of each known risk, including a risk's category, description, unique identification number, projected impact, likelihood of occurrence, and risk response plan. For better visualization, you could use this information to create a scatter plot that represents each risk's possible impact in relation to its overall probability. A risk matrix, which is also known as a heat map, illustrates a loss's likelihood and impact. Notice that the colors in this example range from cool to hot. If an occurrence's possibility is rare and its impact moderate, it gets a low rating. If its likelihood is high, but the impact is insignificant, it might end up with a medium rating. And if the impact is severe and the likelihood almost certain, it might receive an extreme rating. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed risk analysis. We looked at calculating risks quantitatively and qualitatively, and we discussed a few ways to illustrate our findings.",

It emphasizes the importance of assessing the financial implications of these threats to inform decision-making and resource allocation for effective risk management. This practical application aids organizations in developing strategies to mitigate risks and enhance overall security posture.",
