Key concepts include risk identification, risk assessment, mitigation, and monitoring. Risk appetite and risk tolerance are important in defining how much risk an organization is willing to accept. Methods such as ad hoc, recurring, one-time, or continuous risk assessments help organizations accurately understand their risks. Ultimately, effective risk management helps safeguard the organization's information assets, maintain regulatory compliance, and support strategic objectives. Risk Management Processes Identification of critical systems Mission essential functions Risk identification and assessment Risk management strategies Risk transference Risk acceptance Risk Management Processes Risk management is a process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities and threats to the essential functions that a business must perform to serve its customers. You can think of this process as being performed over five phases: Identify Mission Essential Functions — mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure so it is important to focus efforts. Effective risk management must focus on mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed. Part of this process involves identifying critical systems and assets that support these functions. Identify Vulnerabilities — for each function or workflow (starting with the most critical), analyze systems and assets to discover and list any vulnerabilities or weaknesses to which they may be susceptible. Identify Threats — for each function or workflow, identify the threat sources and actors that may take advantage of or exploit or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities. Analyze Business Impacts — the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat and the impact of that incident on critical systems are the factors used to assess risk. There are quantitative and qualitative methods of analyzing impacts and likelihood. Identify Risk Response — for each risk, identify possible countermeasures and assess the cost of deploying additional security controls. Most risks require some sort of mitigation, but other types of response might be more appropriate for certain types and levels of risks. Identification of Critical Systems To support the resiliency of mission essential and primary business functions, it is crucial to perform an identification of critical systems. This means compiling an inventory of business processes and the assets that support them. Asset types include the following: People (employees, visitors, and suppliers). Tangible assets (buildings, furniture, equipment and machinery (plant), ICT equipment, electronic data files, and paper documents). Intangible assets (ideas, commercial reputation, brand, and so on). Procedures (supply chains, critical procedures, standard operating procedures). For mission essential functions, it is important to reduce the number of dependencies between components. Dependencies are identified by performing a business process analysis (BPA) for each function. The BPA should identify the following factors: Inputs — the sources of information for performing the function (including the impact if these are delayed or out of sequence). Hardware — the particular server or datacenter that performs the processing. Staff and other resources supporting the function. Outputs — the data or resources produced by the function. Process Flow — a step-by-step description of how the function is performed. Business impact analysis (BIA) is a process that helps businesses understand the potential effects of disruptions on their operations. It involves identifying and assessing the impact of various unplanned threat scenarios on the business, such as accidents, emergencies, and disasters. By conducting a BIA, businesses can proactively create recovery strategies to minimize the impact of disruptions and ensure operational resilience. For instance, if a DDoS attack suspends an e-commerce portal for five hours, the business impact analysis will be able to quantify the losses from orders not made and customers moving permanently to other suppliers based on historic data. The likelihood of a DoS attack can be assessed on an annualized basis to determine annualized impact in terms of costs. This informatioin is used to assess whether a security control, such as load balancing or managed DDoS mitigation, is worth the investment. Mission Essential Functions A mission essential function (MEF) is one that cannot be deferred. This means that the organization must be able to perform the function as close to continually as possible, and if there is any service disruption, the mission essential functions must be restored first. Functions that act as support for the business or an MEF, but are not critical in themselves, are referred to as primary business functions (PBF). Analysis of mission essential functions is generally governed by four main metrics: Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) is the longest period of time that a business function outage may occur for without causing irrecoverable business failure. Each business process can have its own MTD, such as a range of minutes to hours for critical functions, 24 hours for urgent functions, seven days for normal functions, and so on. MTDs vary by company and event. Each function may be supported by multiple systems and assets. The MTD sets the upper limit on the amount of recovery time that system and asset owners have to resume operations. For example, an organization specializing in medical equipment may be able to exist without incoming manufacturing supplies for three months because it has stockpiled a sizable inventory. After three months, the organization will not have sufficient supplies and may not be able to manufacture additional products, therefore leading to failure. In this case, the MTD is three months. Recovery time objective (RTO) is the period following a disaster that an individual IT system may remain offline. This represents the amount of time it takes to identify that there is a problem and then perform recovery (restore from backup or switch to an alternative system, for instance). Work Recovery Time (WRT). Following systems recovery, there may be additional work to reintegrate different systems, test overall functionality, and brief system users on any changes or different working practices so that the business function is again fully supported. RTO + WRT must not exceed MTD! Recovery point objective (RPO) is the amount of data loss that a system can sustain, measured in time. That is, if a database is destroyed by a virus, an RPO of 24 hours means that the data can be recovered (from a backup copy) to a point not more than 24 hours before the database was infected. RPO is determined by identifying the maximum acceptable data loss an organization can tolerate in the event of a disaster or system failure and is established by considering factors such as business requirements, data criticality, and regulatory or contractual obligations. The calculation of RPO directly impacts the frequency of data backups, data replication requirements, recovery site selection, and technologies that support failover and high availability. Images © 123RF.com Description For example, a customer relationship management database might be able to sustain the loss of a few hours' or days' worth of data because employees can generally remember who they have contacted and the conversations they had over this time span. Conversely, order processing is generally more time sensitive, as data losses will represent lost orders, and it may be impossible to recapture them or the related processes initiated by order processing systems, such as accounting and fulfillment data. MTD and RPO help to determine which business functions are critical and also to specify appropriate risk countermeasures. For example, if your RPO is measured in days, then a simple tape backup system should suffice; if RPO is zero or measured in minutes or seconds, a more expensive server cluster backup and redundancy solution will be required. Mean time to repair (MTTR) and mean time between failures (MTBF) are key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the reliability and efficiency of systems, processes, and equipment. Both metrics are important to risk management processes, providing measurable insights into potential risks and supporting risk mitigation strategies. MTTR and MTBF guide decisions regarding system design, maintenance practices, and redundancy or failover requirements. Mean time between failures (MTBF) represents the expected lifetime of a product. The calculation for MTBF is the total operational time divided by the number of failures. For example, if you have 10 appliances that run for 50 hours and two of them fail, the MTBF is 250 hours/failure (10*50)/2. Mean time to repair (MTTR) is a measure of the time taken to correct a fault so that the system is restored to full operation. This can also be described as mean time to replace or recover. MTTR is calculated as the total number of hours of unplanned maintenance divided by the number of failure incidents. This average value can be used to estimate whether a recovery time objective (RTO) is achievable. A lower MTTR indicates quicker restoration of functionality, reducing downtime and potential disruptions to operations. This information helps allocate resources, prioritize maintenance activities, and optimize repair processes. MTBF identifies the average time between system or equipment failures. A higher MTBF suggests greater reliability and longer intervals between failures, which can affect maintenance scheduling, spare part management, and overall system performance. Based on MTBF data, organizations can make decisions regarding maintenance strategies, equipment replacement, and investments in improving reliability. Risk Identification and Assessment Risk identification is fundamental to managing cybersecurity risks. It includes recognizing risks such as malware attacks, phishing attempts, insider threats, equipment failures, software vulnerabilities, and nontechnical risks like inadequate policies or training. Risk identification methods include vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, security audits, threat intelligence, and other methods. Risk identification is the foundation for risk assessment and management practices. Effective risk identification processes allow organizations to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, risk mitigation strategies, and overall risk management practices. Risk Management Strategies Risk management strategies describe the proactive and systematic approaches used to identify, assess, prioritize, and mitigate risks to minimize their negative impacts. Risk mitigation (or remediation) is the overall process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors. A countermeasure that reduces exposure to a threat or vulnerability describes risk deterrence (or reduction). Risk reduction refers to controls that can either make a risk incident less likely or less costly (or perhaps both). For example, if fire is a significant threat, a policy strictly controlling the use of flammable materials on-site reduces likelihood while a system of alarms and sprinklers reduces impact by (hopefully) containing any incident to a small area. Another example is off-site data backup, which provides a remediation option in the event of servers being destroyed by fire. Avoidance means to stop the activity that is causing risk. For example, a company may develop an internally developed application for managing inventory and then try to sell it. During the sales process, the application may be discovered to have numerous security vulnerabilities that generate complaints and threats of legal action. The company may decide that the cost of maintaining the security of the software is not worth the revenue it generates and its development. Avoidance is infrequently a credible option. Risk Transference Transference (or sharing) means assigning risk to a third party, such as an insurance company. Specific cybersecurity insurance or cyber liability coverage protects against fines and liabilities arising from data breaches and attacks. Note that in this sort of case it is relatively simple to transfer the obvious risks, but risks to the company's reputation remain. If a customer's credit card details are stolen because they used your unsecure e-commerce application, the customer won't care if you or a third party were nominally responsible for security. It is also unlikely that legal liabilities could be completely transferred in this way. For example, insurance terms are likely to require that best practice risk controls have been implemented. It is not possible to eliminate risks, so a major objective of risk management is to determine an appropriate level of allowable risk. The concept of \"allowable risk\" varies greatly between organizations and is dependant on industry sector, leadership style, legal environment, and other factors. Risk Acceptance Risk acceptance (or tolerance) means that no countermeasures are put in place because the level of risk does not justify it. A risk exception describes a situation where a risk cannot be mitigated using standard risk management practices or within a specified time frame due to financial, technical, or operational conditions. A risk exception formally recognizes the risk and seeks to identify alternate mitigating controls, if possible. Relevant stakeholders, such as risk managers or senior executives, must approve all risk exceptions. Risk exceptions should be temporary and reviewed on an established time frame to determine whether the risk levels have changed or if the exception can be removed. A risk exemption is a condition where risk can remain without mitigation, usually due to a strategic business decision. Risk exemptions are generally associated with situations where the cost of mitigating a risk outweighs its potential harm or can lead to significant strategic benefits when accepted. Similarly to risk exceptions, risk exemptions must be formally documented and approved by risk managers or senior executives and periodically reviewed using an established timetable. Description Where inherent risk is the risk before mitigation, residual risk is the likelihood and impact after specific mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures have been applied. Risk appetite is a strategic assessment of what level of residual risk is tolerable. Risk appetite is broad in scope. Where risk acceptance has the scope of a single system, risk appetite has a project- or institution-wide scope. Risk appetite is constrained by regulation and compliance.",
