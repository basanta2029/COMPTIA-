  "full_content": "Now, let's take a look at creating RADIUS clients. I'm going to go into my Network Policy Server management console. You can see up here that we have a list of RADIUS Clients and Remote RADIUS Servers. Whoever's talking to RADIUS needs to be configured as a RADIUS client. The only exception is if RADIUS is installed on the same server as Remote Access, which is actually the case in my environment. In that case, I don't need to configure Routing and Remote Access as a RADIUS client because it's on the same server. When you install the Network Policy and Access server role, it changes what you see in Routing and Remote Access. Let's go into the Properties of my server here and to Security. Before I installed NPS, I had some drop-down combo boxes here that said, \"Do you want to use Windows authentication or RADIUS authentication?\" Now that I've installed NPS, I have to use it to configure authentication and accounting providers. The most I can do here is change my authentication method. Installing NPS changes the interface for Routing and Remote Access. Let's say I had something else that was going to talk to NPS, a wireless router or wireless switch, a wired switch, or some other server that's running Routing and Remote Access, and it wants to talk to this NPS. I'd need to define them as a RADIUS client. I can define RADIUS client templates or right-click here and do a New RADIUS client. I can base this RADIUS client on an existing template. In that case, it will just fill out the information for me, or I can put in the information manually. Then, I need to provide a Shared secret. This will be put in at both the RADIUS client and here at NPS, where I define the RADIUS client. It's just a phrase used to encrypt the connection. I can base it on templates or manually type in the Shared secret. No matter what, I have to define the RADIUS client for it to talk to NPS. After this, you need to go to the RADIUS client itself—the switch, the other router, the other server, whatever's the RADIUS client—and tell it to talk to NPS on this server. How you do that depends on what's using this NPS for authentication, authorization, and accounting. It's always two steps: defining the RADIUS client on NPS and then, at the RADIUS client, defining RADIUS and pointing it to the NPS server. There are several authentication methods using certificates for NPS that will need to be set up in order to have a secure authentication method, such as MS-CHAP V2, MS-CHAP, or CHAP. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we went over the basics of configuring a RADIUS client and looked at how RADIUS affects routing and remote access.",
