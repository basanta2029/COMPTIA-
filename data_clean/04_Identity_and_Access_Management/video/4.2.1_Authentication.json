  "full_content": "In this video, we'll discuss authentication. Authentication involves verifying a claimed identity. To verify an identity, we need some unique information or data that could only come from that individual. Three main factors are used in authentication: something you know, something you have, and something you are. First, let's look at something you know. This commonly used authentication method is knowledge-based. It requires the user to provide information that only they know. The most familiar example is a password. The password is something that only the user should know for their authentication. A PIN is another example of something you know authentication. Unlike a password, a PIN is limited to numerical digits. Another example is cognitive information. This is when a question is provided that only the user can answer. Often, for account recovery methods, a company will ask users to supply answers to specific questions, such as your mother's maiden name or the name of your first pet. The next authentication type, something you have, is sometimes called token-based authentication. Hard tokens require the user to possess a physical factor—an object such as a smart card, key fob, or a USB device—that can be used for authentication. Soft tokens are software that can be installed on a user's smartphone, tablet, or computer. Soft tokens generate one-time passwords (OTPs) that are used for authentication. When users attempt to log in, they must enter their username and password and then generate or receive an OTP from the soft token application. The OTP is time-limited and changes periodically, usually every 30 seconds. This adds an extra layer of security since OTP is unique for each login attempt and cannot be easily replicated or reused by an attacker. The third factor, something you are, refers to physiological attribute biometrics. Your fingerprint, retinal scan, vein scan, face scan, or voice print will prove that you are who you say you are. On their own, some of these authentication methods could be easily compromised. A password can be written down, guessed, or shared. A smart card can be lost or stolen. When two or more of these factors are combined, this is known as multifactor authentication. When the requirement for a password is combined with a token-generated PIN or combined with a fingerprint scan, accessing an account becomes much more complicated. With Multifactor authentication, a username and password can be breached but are unusable without the additional factor! While we've talked about the three main authentication factors, other factors can be used to help validate authentication: somewhere you are, something you do, something you exhibit, and someone you know. While these may not verify a user's identity independently, they help improve security and work well in multifactor authentication settings. Somewhere you are authentication uses a physical location to verify a user's identity. For example, you may have a desktop system configured to allow authentication requests only if the user has passed through the building's entrance using their ID card. If the user tries to log in to the desktop, the system will look to see if the user has entered the building. If not, the user's account is locked. The location could be determined using radio-frequency identification or an RFID proximity reader. If the user is within range, they're authenticated to the system. The user moving out of range automatically locks the system. GPS location data can also be used to unlock mobile devices. For example, your phone can be automatically unlocked within a specific geographical area. If it moves outside that location, it will be locked and require a PIN or password to unlock. Bluetooth can also be used for this type of authentication. If you're in range of a device via Bluetooth, you can configure your mobile device to unlock itself automatically. Another authentication type is something you do. This type requires the user to perform a particular action to verify the user's identity. For example, the user might be required to supply a handwriting sample analyzed against a baseline sample. It could also require a typing test, where the user must type some sample text, and their typing behaviors are analyzed against a baseline sample. Another attribute could be something you exhibit, such as a personality trait or a habit. Authentication systems can note the time of day you usually log on, your access method, or the tasks you often perform. When administrators notice unusual activity or risky behavior, they may restrict access to these users. This could mean requiring a password change, another authentication method, or blocking user access. Another authentication factor is someone you know. You've probably heard the phrase, \"It's not what you know, it's who you know.\" Having someone who can vouch for you can go a long way to establishing relationships and building trust. The same is true for authentication. An example of this trust is certificates. Certificate authorities issue certificates to organizations that they trust. These organizations are intermediary certificate authorities who then issue certificates to their users. This creates a chain of trust that verifies that the subject named in the certificate can be trusted and has been verified by a certificate authority. Certificates are commonly used for logging into secure sites or signing documents electronically. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed the three main factors of authentication. These include something you know, something you have, and something you are. We also discussed other authentication factors, such as somewhere you are, something you do, something you exhibit, and someone you know.",
