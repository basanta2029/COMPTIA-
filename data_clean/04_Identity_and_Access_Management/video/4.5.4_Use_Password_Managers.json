  "full_content": "With the large number of passwords you may accumulate from websites, computer logins, or even network equipment, you may consider using a password manager to store your passwords securely. Most password managers offer a way to configure two-factor authentication, so in the event a hacker obtains your password for the password manager, they'd be stopped by the two-factor authentication process used to log in to the password manager. Today, we're going to look at a product called Bitwarden. This is a very popular password manager that offers excellent protection for your passwords. Best of all, the starting plan for this is free. There are some options, as you can see here, that offer better protection if you decide to pay. Some of these options include Advanced 2FA, which is the same as two-factor authentication. If you have a business, you can use a paid business option to store your business passwords. We've already created our Bitwarden account; however, when you create your account, two-factor authentication (2FA) isn't set up yet. To set this up, we must go to our account options and select Account settings. On the Security tab, there will be an option for Two-step login. The paid options allow the use of Yubikey, Duo, or WebAuthn. For this account, we'll set up an authenticator app and use Authy. It will first prompt for the master password just to make sure you want to do this. This next screen is important. From here, you'd download your authenticator app on your phone. Two examples are Authy and Google Authenticator. Although I can't show the app part, once installed, you can bring up the app, add an account, and then use your phone's camera to scan the QR code to simply add Bitwarden to Authy. Once added, use the latest six-digit code from Authy to finish this setup. Now that we have 2FA set up let's test it out. If we Log out of our account and then re-enter our email address and password, you'll see that it will now prompt for a 2FA code instead of just logging you in. After we input our six-digit code, we're successfully logged in. Our authentication is configured properly, so let's add some passwords. All we have to do is click New Item. We can define what this item is, like a Login, Card, Identity, or a Secure note. For now, let's stick with Login. Next, we need to give it a name, configure a username, and input the password. Keep in mind this will save the password for whatever login you've already configured, say from Outlook, Yahoo, or even your favorite forum site. In order for a browser extension to pick up the password, you must set a URL. We'll see why in the next step. If, by chance, you wish to write a note about this password, it gives you that option. Let's Save our password. This next part makes it super easy to log in to websites. Most password managers have a browser extension, so let's add that. Going to the three dots and selecting Extensions allows us to find the one we're looking for. After typing Bitwarden, this is the one we want. Extensions don't always show up on the toolbar, so let's change that setting. Going back to our Extension settings, we can choose to make Bitwarden show in the toolbar. This makes it a lot easier to access passwords. When the extension is set up, we'll be required to re-login with our username, password, and code from our authenticator app. Regardless of whether it's logging into Bitwarden on a website, extension, or even a phone app, it should be the same process. The main thing we want to see is if the username and password get populated in the fields presented on a website, so let's test this. Two ways we can get to the site are to manually type it in or use the arrow button to launch the URL from the password. Either way, you'll get to the same place. Once you click Sign in, you'll be prompted for your email. You can see that when we go up to our Bitwarden extension, we have one available login. When clicked, it will populate the fields on the screen. It will also do the same for the password—granted, this isn't a real login; however, you get the idea of how it can auto-populate a username and password without typing it in each time. Let's go back to Bitwarden to show some other features. Say you'd like to put a secure note in; what we could do is add a New Item. In this case, we're going to select a Secure note. Say this is my combination lock for my shed, and I don't want to forget this combination. We could write a note for this and then Save it. Now, you can see how useful this password manager can be in securing all your information. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we showed you how to set up and configure a password manager.",
