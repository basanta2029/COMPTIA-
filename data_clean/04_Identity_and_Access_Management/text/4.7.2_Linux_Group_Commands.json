These commands include groupadd, groupmod, groupdel, and usermod for creating, modifying, deleting groups, and managing user group assignments to enforce principle of least privilege. Proper group management is critical for maintaining secure multi-user environments and implementing role-based access control (RBAC) in Linux systems.",
