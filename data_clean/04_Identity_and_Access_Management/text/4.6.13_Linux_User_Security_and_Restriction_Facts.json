User Security Commands The following table describes Linux commands used to promote user security and restrictions: Command Description chage -M sets the maximum number of days before the password expires. -W sets the number of days before the password expires that a warning message displays. -m sets the minimum number of days that must pass after a password has been changed before a user can change the password again. ulimit Limits computer resources used for applications launched from the shell. Limits can be hard or soft limits. Soft limits can be temporarily exceeded up to the hard limit setting. Users can modify soft limits, but only the root user can modify hard limits. Options include: -c limits the size of a core dump file. The value is in blocks. -f limits the file size of files created using the shell session. The value is in blocks. -n limits the maximum number of files that can be open. -t limits the amount of CPU time a process can use.

      "summary": "Linux user security involves implementing proper user account management, access controls, and privilege restrictions to minimize attack surfaces and prevent unauthorized system access. Key security measures include configuring user permissions, implementing sudo restrictions, managing group memberships, and enforcing password policies to maintain system integrity. Effective Linux user restriction strategies focus on the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their designated functions.",
