  "full_content": "Security Pro 8.0 Change management is a systematic approach to managing all changes made within an IT infrastructure. Its primary goal is to minimize risk and disruption while maximizing the value and efficiency of organizational changes. Change management relies on effective planning, testing, approval, and implementation of various changes ranging from minor updates to complicated system migrations. Change management must consider the potential impacts and dependencies of all proposed changes and mandate the development of contingency and rollback plans in case changes lead to unforeseen problems. Proper documentation and communication are also essential, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders understand the details of proposed changes and their implications. Change management programs promote a controlled progression of software and the IT infrastructure and contribute to its resilience and stability. Change management programs Factors driving change management Allowed and blocked changes Restarts, dependencies, and downtime Legacy systems and applications Documentation and version control Change Management Programs Change management plays a vital role in an organization's security operations. It refers to a systematic approach that manages all changes made to a product or system, ensuring that methods and procedures are used to handle these changes efficiently and effectively. This helps minimize risks associated with the changes, ensuring they do not negatively impact the organization's security posture, service availability, or performance. A non-comprehensive list of changes typically managed in a change management program includes the following: Software deployments System updates Software patching Hardware replacements or upgrades Network modifications Changes to system configurations New product implementations New software integrations Changes and refreshes to support environments If not properly managed, these changes can introduce new vulnerabilities into the system, disrupt services, or negatively impact the organization's compliance status. A robust change management program allows all changes to be tracked, assessed, approved, and reviewed. Each change must include documentation, including details describing what will be changed, the reasons for the change, any potential impacts, and a rollback plan in case the change does not work as planned. Each change must be subject to risk assessment to identify potential security impacts. Appropriate personnel must approve changes before implementation to ensure accountability and ensure changes align with business priorities. After implementations, changes must be reviewed and audited to ensure they have been completed correctly and achieved their stated outcome without compromising security. Systematic management of changes supports an organization's ability to reduce unexpected downtime and system vulnerabilities. Change management programs contribute to operational resilience by ensuring that changes support business objectives without compromising security or compliance. A typical change management approval process involves several stages designed to ensure proper assessment and approval of change proposals. Change requests usually begin with submitting a request for change (RFC) that outlines the details of the proposed change, including its purpose, scope, and potential impact. The change request is reviewed by a designated change manager or committee that assesses its feasibility, risks, alignment with organizational objectives, and policy compliance. Following initial review, the change request undergoes a formal approval process involving relevant stakeholders, such as management, IT teams, and any impacted departments, to ensure consensus and authorization before the change is implemented. Throughout the process, documentation and communication are crucial in tracking the status and outcome of approved changes. The implementation of changes should be carefully planned, with consideration for how the change will affect dependent components. For most significant or major changes, organizations should attempt to trial the change first. Every change should be accompanied by a rollback (or remediation) plan so that the change can be reversed if it has harmful or unforeseen consequences. Changes should also be scheduled sensitively if they are likely to cause system downtime or other negative impacts on the workflow of the business units that depend on the IT system being modified. Most networks have a scheduled maintenance window period for authorized downtime. When the change has been implemented, its impact should be assessed, and the process reviewed and documented to identify any outcomes that could help future change management projects. Factors Driving Change Management Change management requires the expertise of individuals from various parts of an organization to oversee and implement changes effectively. Examples include IT professionals with technical knowledge, business leaders with operational knowledge, and compliance officers with legal expertise. The involvement of these  stakeholders (which includes anyone with a vested interest in the change or project being implemented or developed) facilitates a comprehensive review of proposed changes, helping to identify non-obvious risks and identify effective implementation plans that minimize risks and business disruptions. Additionally, including diverse stakeholders promotes acceptance and adoption of the changes because they were involved in the planning and decision-making process. Stakeholder participation fosters ownership and responsibility, which are crucial for successful change implementation. Ownership in change management refers to individuals or groups primarily responsible for implementing a specific change. Owners can be project managers, team leaders, or anyone responsible for the change. Owners are accountable for ensuring that the change is implemented as planned, risks are managed effectively, and there's a clear plan for communication and training associated with the change. They also ensure that all stakeholders appropriately review and approve the proposed change. Stakeholders in the change management process describe the individuals or groups impacted (or interested) in the change and include employees, managers, the Change Advisory Board (CAB), and sometimes even customers, vendors, and partners. Stakeholder engagement is critical to successful change management because keeping stakeholders informed about changes, understanding their concerns, and addressing their needs improves the likelihood of the change being accepted and implemented smoothly. Allowed and Blocked Changes Allow lists and deny lists play a significant role in change management practices and can reference two different viewpoints. One scenario views allow and deny lists in relation to change types or from a different view. Allow and block lists describe software restriction approaches designed to control computer software. In terms of change management, an allow list describes a list of approved software, hardware, and specific change types (such as routine or low-risk changes) that are not required to go through the entire change management process. An allow list may also include specific individuals with change management approval authority. Allow lists help streamline change management by reducing the time and effort required for trusted or preauthorized changes. Allow lists must be updated via regular reviews to stay corrected with changing organizational needs. A deny list includes explicitly blocked software, hardware, and specific change types. The block list might include software and hardware with known security or compatibility issues, high-risk or high-impact changes that must always go through the full change management process, or individuals who are not authorized to implement or approve changes. In this regard, deny lists help prevent unauthorized or risky changes from being implemented. They can serve as a security measure to clearly identify off-limits change types so there is no room for negotiation or misinterpretation. Allow and block lists also refer to technical controls that exist in a few different contexts, including access controls, firewall rules, and software restriction mechanisms. Allow and block lists can impact change implementation by causing unintended problems. For example, software allow lists can be negatively impacted by software patching. If allow lists are based on executable file hash values, they will fail to recognize newly patched executables after patching because their hash values will change. This can result in fully patched systems that are unusable by employees because none of the previously allowed software can run. Regarding change management, it is important to incorporate the potential impacts of allow and block lists into the testing plan. Software Restriction Policies (block list) can be based on file hash values Screenshot used with permission from Microsoft Description Restricted activities refer to actions or changes that require additional scrutiny, strict controls, or higher levels of approval/authorization due to their potential impact on critical systems, sensitive data, or regulatory compliance. Restarts, Dependencies, and Downtime Service and application restarts, as well as downtime, are critical considerations because they typically have a direct impact on business operations. For example, reconfigurations and patching changes often require restarting services or applications, leading to downtime. One of the primary goals of change management is to minimize these disruptions by scheduling restarts or downtime events during maintenance windows or off-peak times to reduce the impact on users and business processes. Change management processes include communication requirements designed to ensure relevant stakeholders are aware of service outages so they can prepare accordingly. Effective change communication enhances the visibility of the change management process among stakeholders and fosters a culture of transparency and cooperation. Services and applications often depend on other software, interfaces, and services to function correctly. These  dependencies complicate changes because a service restart in one area may significantly impact another. For example, if a database server is restarted, all applications that rely (depend) on the database will likely experience issues or downtime. A change that initially appeared to be minor may impact a wide range of the organization's operations. A careful analysis of software and system dependencies is critical for reasons like these. Understanding what services depend on each other, how restarts impact them, and what measures need to be taken to mitigate potential impacts help avoid unintended outages. Dependencies also impact the time needed for a change. If a service restart requires other services to be shut down or restarted, the overall change process will need more time. Additionally, backout plans may also need to consider dependencies as part of the process, which will also require additional time. Understanding the risks associated with restarts and downtime drives the development of effective backout plans and downtime contingencies, ensuring the organization is well-prepared to handle any potential complications and unintended consequences related to the change. Additionally, understanding risks associated with a change also supports the development of post-change performance monitoring to validate that systems function as required and help detect issues quickly. Sometimes, the potential risks of a change causing significant disruption require the organization to identify alternative solutions. Some typical IT changes that generally require service or application restarts and result in downtime are as follows: Change Type Description Software upgrades and patches\tWhen upgrading software applications, especially major version updates or patches, a restart of the application is typically needed to apply the changes effectively and ensure the updated version is fully functional. Configuration changes\tMany system configuration changes, such as modifying server settings, network configurations, or database parameters, require a restart of the affected services to apply the changed configurations properly. Infrastructure changes\tWhen changing infrastructure components, such as switches, routers, firewalls, and load balancers, it is typically necessary to restart the devices to apply the changes and ensure they do not negatively impact operation. Security changes\tImplementing specific security measures, such as updating encryption protocols, enabling or disabling security features, or modifying access control settings, may require a restart of the services or applications to enforce the new security configurations effectively. Downtime refers to the scheduled time designated for changes to be implemented (scheduled downtime) or the amount of time a service or application is unavailable (unscheduled downtime). Legacy Systems and Applications Legacy applications pose unique challenges regarding change management as these systems are often critical to business operations and are difficult to manage. Many legacy applications are built using outdated technology, which introduces compatibility issues when implementing changes. For example, new software or security updates may be incompatible with legacy systems. These Incompatibility issues might require specialized solutions, such as virtualization, emulation, interpreters, custom \"fit-gap\" software, or modifications to the newer components to ensure compatibility. These accommodations further complicate the manageability of the legacy application. Legacy applications often lack comprehensive documentation or have been heavily customized over years or even decades, making them extremely difficult to manage. This complexity necessitates extensive testing and meticulous implementation plans to help avoid unintended consequences or outages. Legacy applications also typically lack vendor support, removing the option to \"call for help,\" which increases the risks associated with any change. A lack of vendor support coupled with high complexity, poor documentation, and business criticality make legacy systems a significant security problem. Documentation and Version Control Version control refers to tracking and controlling changes to documents, code, or other important data. Organizations can use version control to maintain a historical record of changes, ensure only approved changes are implemented, and quickly revert changes to a previous version as warranted. Version control is also important when diagrams, policies, and procedures require updates. In this way, version control prevents confusion associated with using outdated or inconsistent documents. Assessing how a change impacts existing policies, procedures, and diagrams is essential, and change management plans should include provisions requiring updates to these documents as part of the implementation. The frequency of diagram and documentation updates varies, but they are typically updated whenever significant changes or modifications to a process, system, or application occur. Once document updates have been completed, the new versions should be clearly labeled, and the older versions should be archived but still available for reference. Major changes may necessitate training for relevant teams or departments. Change management is a crucial aspect of implementing changes to a system or application. By assessing the potential technical implications of these changes, organizations can take necessary steps to minimize disruptions. Effective change management requires following specific processes, such as developing implementation plans and conducting thorough testing procedures. Through change management, leadership can ensure that any changes made are successful and contribute positively to the organization. Some examples of different documentation impacted by change management include the following: Item Description Change requests\tChange requests themselves should be reviewed and updated to reflect the details and status of the change, including any modifications or approvals during the change management process. Policies and procedures\tChanges may impact existing policies and procedures. As a result, these documents need to be reviewed and updated to ensure they align with the new processes, guidelines, or controls introduced through the change. System or process documentation Documentation should reflect any changes to systems, applications, or processes. It may involve updating system architecture, diagrams, process flows, standard operating procedures (SOPs), or user manuals to represent the current state and functionality of the changed system. Configuration management documentation\tChanges to configuration items, such as servers, networks, or databases, should be tracked and documented within the configuration management system to maintain an accurate record of its configuration. Training materials\tChanges often impact employees, and they may require more training. Existing training materials, such as presentations, manuals, or computer-based learning modules, must be reviewed and updated as warranted. Incident response and recovery plans\tChanges made to systems or applications may necessitate updates to incident response and recovery plans to ensure they account for the revised configurations, new dependencies, or recovery procedures resulting from the change. Policies and procedures must change as often as technology does, which is often! Settings Theater Mode Full Screen Play Video Video Control Resume Play Volume Control Play Speed Interactive Script",
