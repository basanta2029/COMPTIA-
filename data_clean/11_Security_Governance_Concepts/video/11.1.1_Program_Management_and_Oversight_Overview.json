This ensures that all security controls put in place are being implemented and working properly. In this lesson, we'll look at some of the key elements of effective security governance, including organizational standards, external considerations, and ongoing monitoring and revision of the security plan. A proper security plan will include policies, procedures, guidelines, and standards. Policies are essentially organizational rules that must be followed by employees. A common example is an Acceptable Use Policy. Procedures outline how certain functions should be performed. Guidelines are designed to provide support and additional information on policies and procedures. Standards define how the policies are implemented. For example, an organization may have a policy that access control must be implemented on certain data types. The organization would then implement standards that define who can access the data, how they can access it, and how access is monitored. Password policies are typically defined in an organization. The standards define the length and complexity of the password, how often a password can be reused, and how often the password should be changed. For example, the standards might state that the password should be a minimum of 8 characters, including upper and lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and that there should not be a set time to change the password. The standard can even define that multi-factor authentication should be used. Some other common standards an organization should have defined include physical security measures such as cameras, physical access control, and security guard schedules and placements. To protect sensitive data, encryption standards should also be defined and implemented throughout the organization. External considerations must be looked at when establishing internal policies. Perhaps the biggest external consideration is any laws that apply to the organization. For example, in the health industry, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, establishes laws and regulations that must be followed by any health organization. These laws and regulations define how data is secured, who can access patient data, and more. When internal policies are established, they must adhere to the regulations established by the law. Aside from regulatory and legal compliance, we also need to consider any industry standards that may be in place. For example, in the IT field, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, publishes various industry standards. While these aren't laws or regulations, these industry standards are put into place to define specific practices that should promote performance and efficiency. While some standards are globally accepted, others differ between countries, states, and even between cities. Monitoring and updating of all policies and standards should take place on a regular basis. As new technologies come out, new laws and industry standards will be released. It's up to the organization to review these and update their internal policies and standards as needed. That'll wrap up this lesson on program management and oversight. In this lesson, we first went over the differences in standards, policies, procedures, and guidelines. Standards define how policies should be implemented and are a core component of any security governance plan. We then looked at some external factors that should be considered when developing a security plan. These include legal and regulatory compliance, industry standards, and even global, national, and local standards and practices. We wrapped up by going over why it's important to monitor and revise the plans to stay current with industry and regulatory changes.",

      "summary": "In the CompTIA Security+ course, the section on Standards emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive security plan that includes policies, procedures, guidelines, and standards. Policies dictate organizational rules, while procedures detail the execution of tasks, guidelines offer additional support, and standards specify the implementation of these policies, such as password complexity and access control measures. Practical applications include defining encryption standards and physical security measures to safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance within the organization.",
