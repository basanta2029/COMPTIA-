Pen testing is also referred to as ethical hacking. A pen test might involve the following steps: Verify a Threat Exists — use surveillance, social engineering, network scanners, and vulnerability assessment tools to identify a vector by which vulnerabilities could be exploited. Bypass Security Controls — look for easy ways to attack the system. For example, if the network is strongly protected by a firewall, is it possible to gain physical access to a computer in the building and run malware from a USB stick? Actively Test Security Controls — probe controls for configuration weaknesses and errors, such as weak passwords or software vulnerabilities. Exploit Vulnerabilities — prove a vulnerability is a high risk by exploiting it to access data or install backdoors. The critical difference from passive vulnerability assessment is that an attempt is made to actively test security controls and exploit any vulnerabilities discovered. Pen testing is an intrusive assessment technique. For example, a vulnerability scan may reveal that an SQL Server has not been patched to safeguard against a known exploit. A penetration test would attempt to use the exploit to perform code injection and compromise the server. This provides active testing of security controls. Active and Passive Reconnaissance Active and passive reconnaissance provides crucial information that helps penetration testers understand target systems and identify potential vulnerabilities to plan an attack effectively. A combination of active and passive reconnaissance techniques yields the most comprehensive information regarding the target environment during a penetration testing engagement. Active reconnaissance involves probing and interacting with target systems and networks to gather information. Active reconnaissance includes activities that generate network traffic by directly requesting information from target systems. Active reconnaissance aims to discover and obtain information about the target infrastructure, services, and potential vulnerabilities. Standard techniques used in active reconnaissance include the following: Port Scanning — scanning a target network to identify open ports and their services. Service Enumeration — interacting with identified services to gather information about their versions, configurations, and potential vulnerabilities. OS Fingerprinting — attempting to identify the operating system running on target machines by analyzing network responses and behavior. DNS Enumeration — gathering information about the target's DNS infrastructure, such as domain names, subdomains, and IP addresses. Web Application Crawling — exploring web applications to identify pages, directories, and potential vulnerabilities. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering — collecting publicly available information from various sources like search engines, social media, public databases, and websites. Network Traffic Analysis — monitoring network traffic to identify patterns, devices, IP addresses, and potential vulnerabilities without actively generating traffic. Social Engineering — gathering information through social engineering techniques, such as deceiving employees and vendors to extract sensitive information or access credentials. Passive reconnaissance helps penetration testers gather initial information on a target's digital footprint. It is less intrusive and has a lower detection risk than active reconnaissance techniques. Known, Partially Known, and Unknown Testing Methods The decision to use a known environment, partially known environment, or unknown environment penetration test is influenced by several factors, such as knowledge regarding the target system or network, the organization's risk appetite, and compliance requirements. Budget and resource constraints may also contribute to selecting the penetration testing method, as known environment testing generally requires fewer resources than partially known or unknown environment testing. The objectives of the penetration test influence the choice, with known environment testing suitable for assessing known vulnerabilities and partially known or unknown environment testing preferred for identifying unknown vulnerabilities. The complexity of the target system or network is also a factor, as more complex systems may necessitate more comprehensive testing methods. Organizations often combine different methods to achieve other objectives. Exercise Types Penetration testing is a crucial component of cybersecurity assessments that involves simulating real-world attacks on computer systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Different types of penetration tests exist to address specific objectives related to a security evaluation, such as testing specific systems, assessing incident response capabilities, measuring the effectiveness of physical controls, and many other areas. Different types of penetration tests allow organizations to use a flexible and prioritized approach toward security assessment. Physical penetration testing, or physical security testing, describes assessments of an organization's physical security practices and controls. It involves simulating real-world attack scenarios to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in physical security systems, such as access controls, surveillance, and perimeter defenses. Physical penetration testing aims to assess the effectiveness of physical security controls and identify potential entry points or weaknesses that an attacker could exploit. During physical penetration testing, a skilled tester attempts to gain unauthorized physical access to restricted areas, sensitive information, or critical assets within the organization using techniques like social engineering, tailgating, lock picking, bypassing alarms or surveillance systems, and exploiting physical vulnerabilities. Integrated penetration testing refers to a holistic approach that combines different types of penetration testing methodologies and techniques to assess the overall security of an organization's systems, networks, applications, and physical infrastructure. Integrated penetration testing aims to provide a comprehensive and realistic evaluation of an organization's security operations. The importance of integrated penetration testing lies in its ability to accurately represent the organization's security posture and identify potential risks often overlooked when testing in isolated areas. For example, offensive and defensive penetration testing comprehensively assesses an organization's security posture. Offensive testing identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses, while defensive testing evaluates the organization's ability to detect and respond to threats. By integrating both approaches, organizations can improve their security capabilities to better protect against different threats. Continuous pen testing is a similar concept, which focuses on technical vulnerabilities and is often configured to leverage automation, especially for CI/CD environments.
