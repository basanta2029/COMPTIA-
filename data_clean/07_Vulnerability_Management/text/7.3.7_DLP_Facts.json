However, an organization that creates and collects large amounts of personal data usually needs automated tools to assist with this task. Protecting valuable intellectual property (IP) data may also be required. Data loss prevention (DLP) products automate the discovery and classification of data types and enforce rules so that data is not viewed or transferred without proper authorization. Such solutions will usually consist of the following components: Policy server — to configure classification, confidentiality, and privacy rules and policies, log incidents, and compile reports. Endpoint agents — to enforce policy on client computers, even when they are not connected to the network. Network agents — to scan communications at network borders and interface with web and messaging servers to enforce policy. DLP agents scan content in structured formats, such as a database with a formal access control model, or unstructured formats, such as email or word processing documents. A file cracking process is applied to unstructured data to render it in a consistent scannable format. The transfer of content to removable media, such as USB devices, by email, instant messaging, or even social media, can be blocked if it does not conform to a predefined policy. Most DLP solutions can extend the protection mechanisms to cloud storage services, using either a proxy to mediate access or the cloud service provider's API to perform scanning and policy enforcement. Remediation is the action the DLP software takes when it detects a policy violation. The following remediation mechanisms are typical: Alert only — copying is allowed, but the management system records an incident and may alert an administrator. Block — the user is prevented from copying the original file but retains access. The user may or may not be alerted to the policy violation, but it will be logged as an incident by the management engine. Quarantine — access to the original file is denied to the user (or possibly any user). This might be accomplished by encrypting the file or moving it to a quarantine area in the file system. Tombstone — the original file is quarantined and replaced with one describing the policy violation and how the user can re-release it. When configured to protect a communications channel such as email, DLP remediation might take place using client-side or server-side mechanisms. For example, some DLP solutions prevent attaching files to the email before sending it. Others might scan the email attachments and message content, strip out specific data, or stop the email from reaching its destination.",

      "summary": "This lesson on Data Loss Prevention (DLP) emphasizes the importance of automated tools for classifying and protecting sensitive data, particularly in organizations handling large volumes of personal information. Key components of DLP solutions include policy servers, endpoint agents, and network agents, which enforce data protection policies and prevent unauthorized data transfers. Various remediation mechanisms, such as alerting, blocking, quarantining, and tombstoning, are employed to address policy violations and ensure compliance across different data formats and communication channels.",
