This can include physical and network security. Types of penetration tests Security teams Documentation/contracts Penetration testing life cycle Types of Penetration Tests The purpose of a penetration test is to discover any vulnerability in an organization's network or physical security. Different types of penetration tests can be performed to simulate internal or external threats. The following table details the types of penetration tests: Penetration Test Type\tDescription Known environment (previously known as white box) testing\tThe penetration tester is given full knowledge of the target or network. This test allows for a comprehensive and thorough test but is unrealistic. Unknown environment (previously known as black box) testing\tThe penetration tester has no information regarding the target or network. This type of test best simulates an outside attack and ignores insider threats. Partially known environment (previously known as gray box) testing\tThe penetration tester is given partial information about the target or network, such as IP configurations, email lists, etc. This test simulates the insider threat. Bug bounties These unique tests are programs that are set up by organizations such as Google, Facebook, and many others. The organization sets strict guidelines and boundaries for ethical hackers to operate within. Any discovered vulnerabilities are reported, and the ethical hacker is paid based on the severity of the vulnerability. Security Teams Depending on their role, members of security operations can be placed on different teams. These teams all work together to discover and fix security vulnerabilities. Security Team\tDescription Red team\tThe red team members are the ethical hackers. This team is responsible for performing the penetration tests. Blue team\tBlue team members are the defense of the system. This team is responsible for stopping the red team's advances. Purple team\tMembers of the purple team work on both offense and defense. This team is a combination of the red and blue teams. White team\tThe white team members are the referees of cybersecurity. This team is responsible for managing the engagement between the red and blue teams. This group typically consists of the managers or team leads. Documentation/Contracts Before any penetration test can take place, the goals and guidelines of the test must be established. These are spelled out in the scope of work and rules of engagement documents. Document Type\tDescription Scope of work The scope of work is a very detailed document that defines exactly what is going to be included in the penetration test. This document is also referred to as the statement of work. This document should answer the: Who - specific IP ranges, servers, applications, etc., should be explicitly listed. What - anything that is off limits, such as specific servers or tactics, should be explicitly listed. When - the time frame for the penetration test. This should identify how long the test will run, the deliverables, and when the deliverables are due. Where - the location of the penetration tester. Sometimes, the penetration tester will be located in a different state. In this case, all parties must agree on which state laws will be followed. Why - the purpose and goals of the test. Penetration tests are often performed for compliance purposes, and these requirements must be detailed in the document. Special considerations, such as travel, required certifications, or anything else unexpected, will be defined in the scope of work. Finally, the scope of work should define payment and how to handle requests for additional work. This will help to reduce scope creep. Rules of engagement The rules of engagement document defines exactly how the penetration test will be carried out. The following should be defined in the rules of engagement: Type of test - whether the test will be a white box, black box, or gray box test. Data handling - an explicit statement of how sensitive data is to be handled. Be aware that the pentester will typically come across sensitive data during a penetration test. Notifications - the detailed process on when and how to notify the IT team. Penetration Testing Life Cycle Once the paperwork is complete, the pentester can begin work. The following table covers the phases of the penetration testing life cycle: Penetration Testing Life Cycle Phase\tDescription Perform reconnaissance\tThe first phase in the pentesting process is reconnaissance, also known as footprinting. In this phase, the pentester begins gathering information on the target. This can include gathering publicly available information, using social engineering techniques, or even dumpster diving. Scan/enumerate Running scans on the target is the second phase. During this phase, the ethical hacker is actively engaged with the target. Enumeration is part of the scanning phase. Enumeration uses scanning techniques to extract information, such as: Usernames Computer names Network resources Share names Running services Gain access The third phase takes all of the information gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases to exploit any discovered vulnerabilities in order to gain access. After gaining access, the pentester can perform lateral moves, pivoting to other machines on the network. The pentester will begin trying to escalate privileges with the goal of gaining administrator access. Maintain access\tOnce the pentester has gained access, maintaining that access becomes the next priority. This can be done by installing backdoors, rootkits, or Trojans. Report\tThe final phase is generating the test results and supporting documentation. After any penetration test, a detailed report must be compiled. Documentation provides extremely important protection for both the penetration tester and the organization.",
