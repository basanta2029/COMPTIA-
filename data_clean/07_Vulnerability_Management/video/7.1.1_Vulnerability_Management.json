Efficient vulnerability management plays a vital role in securing your organization's network. In this video, we'll discuss steps that can be taken to manage vulnerabilities effectively. Let's start by looking at identification. Various sources can be used to identify vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans are automated tools that scan your system for known vulnerabilities. These scans comprehensively analyze your system's current security status, flagging any areas that require immediate attention or improvement. Threat feeds provide real-time updates on cyber threats across the world. These feeds can provide information such as suspicious domains, known malware, known malicious IP addresses, and more. Security defenders can use this information to stay on top of the latest threats that might impact them. Open-source intelligence gathers data from publicly available sources. At the same time, proprietary third-party feeds offer unique intelligence from private companies. Information-sharing organizations offer sector-specific threat intelligence. Dark web intelligence can also provide insights into underground criminal activities, including selling exploit codes and stolen data. Penetration testing, often called \"pen testing,\" is a simulated attack that can be used to test your defenses. They can help to detect security loopholes before malicious actors find them. A responsible disclosure program encourages external individuals to report vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs take responsible disclosure one step further by offering recognition or compensation to individuals who report vulnerabilities. Lastly, system and process audits help to identify deviations from established policies. These audits can help to highlight non-compliance issues and pinpoint inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement in current processes. Next is threat hunting. This involves proactively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats evading security solutions. It's about being proactive instead of reactive, staying one step ahead instead of waiting for an attack to happen. Threat hunting involves using automated and manual techniques to detect cyber threats. It begins with a hypothesis about a potential threat, which is then investigated using data analysis, system logs, and security tools. The goal is to detect hidden threats, understand the extent of any breaches, and identify ways to prevent further attacks. This proactive approach requires an in-depth understanding of an organization's network, including all internal and external connections, system configurations, and data flows. It also requires an understanding of current threat trends and tactics. Automated tools can scan and monitor network traffic, but the human element is crucial in threat hunting. Cybersecurity professionals use their experience and intuition to interpret the data, identify anomalies, and track potential threats. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, they must be analyzed to assess their potential impact. Vulnerability analysis helps prioritize remediation efforts by identifying the most critical vulnerabilities that pose the most significant risk to an organization. Prioritization is typically based on factors such as a vulnerability's severity, the ease of exploitation, and the potential impact of an attack. Prioritizing vulnerabilities helps an organization focus limited resources on addressing the most significant threats first. A standard ranking system is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS. The CVSS determines the vulnerability risk based on three metrics: base, temporal, and environmental. Base metrics describe a vulnerability's unique characteristics. Temporal metrics describe its changeable attributes, and environmental metrics tell what vulnerabilities are only present in specific environments or implementations. Scan results often list the vulnerabilities by their CVE code. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. This is a free and publicly available list of standardized identifiers for known software vulnerabilities and exposures. There are currently 94 CVE numbering authorities from 16 countries, which provides a baseline for evaluation. CVE also provides standardization, which allows data exchange for cybersecurity automation and aids professionals as they determine the best assessment tools for themselves. Depending on the vulnerability analysis results, appropriate steps should be taken to mitigate the identified risks. Some standard remediation practices include patching, cybersecurity insurance, segmentation, and compensating controls. Patching involves updating software or systems to fix security vulnerabilities. The process includes installing 'patches' or updates issued by software vendors to fix identified security loopholes. Cybersecurity insurance is a form of cover that offers a financial safety net in case of cyber-attacks or data breaches. It can cover costs associated with recovery, including incident response, data recovery, legal liability, and customer notification. Segmentation refers to dividing a network into smaller parts or segments. By doing this, organizations can isolate parts of their network, limiting an attacker's ability to move laterally within the system. Compensating controls are alternative security measures implemented when a standard control isn't feasible. These controls help achieve the same security objective and reduce the risk to an acceptable level if the primary control cannot be implemented. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed vulnerability management. We talked about various methods that can be used for identifying vulnerabilities. We discussed how threat hunting, threat analysis, and threat response and remediation can play a vital role in securing an organization's network.",
