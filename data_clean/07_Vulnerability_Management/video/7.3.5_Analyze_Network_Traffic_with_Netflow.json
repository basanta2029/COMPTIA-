Netflow collects active IP network traffic as it flows in or out of an interface. The data is gathered and then analyzed to create a picture of network traffic flow and the volume of traffic. So, why do we use Netflow? Well the NetFlow protocol is used by IT professionals as a network traffic analyzer to determine its point of origin, it's destination, the volume and the paths on the network. Before NetFlow's creation, network IT engineers and administrators would use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for network traffic analysis and monitoring. Although Netflow is a feature was created by Cisco, there are open-source alternatives such as softflowd that can be installed to work with pfsense. This will allow us to capture network traffic and create a picture to better analyze in and out traffic. In order to use softflowd we must install it from the package list. To do so we need to go to system then package manager. Tab over to Available packages. Just to make it easier so were not scrolling for a while type 'softflow' in the search bar and click search. Next, we can click the Install button and then confirm. When the software is installed successfully, we can then configure it. To adjust our settings for softflowd we need to go to services, then softflowd. Make sure at the top it says enabled, Interface can either be LAN or WAN depending on what side of the firewall you would like to capture the data. It is possible to grab data from both if you would like however were just going to select WAN for now. The Host will be the NetFlow analyzer which happens to be '192.168.30.202' on our network. Port will the designated port of your choosing. Sometimes it is a good idea to use an alternative port for security purposes, but for now were using the standard '2055' port for NetFlow. We will leave the max flows to the default '8192'. The NetFlow version will depend on your analyzer's capability. If it doesn't support version ten then you may want to see what version, it does support. I'm going to flip this to version '9' because that is what our analyzer supports. Click save at the bottom. Even though our settings are saved we want to make sure things are working right. There is a command line command you can run to show statistics on softflowd. Go to diagnostics then command prompt. In the Execute shell command field we can insert our command 'softflowctl -c /var/runsoftflowd.vmx0.ctl statistics'. The part that has vmx0 may differ if your network interface is labeled differently. Execute that command and now we can see some results. You may not a lot of traffic yet however you may want to check back later to verify flow packets and byte counts are going up. Now we are ready to send and configure NetFlow to our analyzer. That is, it for this demo, in this demo we installed and configured softflowd.",
