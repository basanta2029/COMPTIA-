At its core, OpenVAS comprises a server packed with a suite of network vulnerability tests designed to identify security issues within remote systems and applications. This versatile tool serves offensive and defensive security professionals, enabling them to assess and uncover potential attack surfaces. In this demonstration, we'll continue to use the traditional name OpenVAS when referring to the scanner. Before diving into this demonstration, I downloaded OpenVAS as a virtual appliance and imported it into a hypervisor, setting it up as a virtual machine. The system is configured, and I've run some tests, so we're ready to proceed. I'm at the login screen and will use the credentials created during the setup phase. After logging in, I'm directed to the Dashboard screen. This provides a quick overview of previous scans and their status. It's important to note that security scanners, like antivirus software, rely on up-to-date definitions. Let's examine this briefly. I'll navigate to the Administration tab and click on Feed Status. This column shows that all our feeds are up to date. I'm particularly interested in the CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Now, let's return to the Dashboards. Please remember that this is a test system, and the abundance of red indicates severe issues. In a typical network, such extensive red flags would be highly unusual and cause serious concern. Now, let's explore the Scans menu. Clicking on Tasks reveals a list of all the tasks I've created. For instance, the \"Scan All\" task scans my entire subnet. In the Reports section, you'll see that I've run this task three times, each resulting in a report. You can also check the last time the task ran and its severity level. If I wish to run the task, I can start by clicking the appropriate arrow icon. Additional actions include deleting, editing, cloning, or exporting the task. Now, let's create a new task. There are a couple of ways to do this. We can use the Task Wizard to quickly create a task with default settings, requiring only the entry of the IP address or hostname, whether a single target or an entire range of devices. Another approach is to click on New Task. I'll name the task Scan All since it's intended for scanning the entire network. Under Scan Targets, we specify what we want to scan. I've created a new target by clicking here. This opens the New Target configuration window. I'll name it Scan All and enter the network address and subnet I want to scan. Here, you can also specify exclusions if there are devices on your network you wish to skip. Credentials can be provided for a more comprehensive scan. After clicking Save, we return to the New Task window. You'll see that the Scan All target is already selected. For this task, we'll leave the rest of the settings at their default values and click Save. Now, looking at the list of tasks, you can find the Scan All task. Since it's new, there have yet to be any reports. While I'm ready to run this task, I want to explore other menu items first. Under the Scans menu, you'll find options like Reports, Results, Vulnerabilities, and more. Reports display a list of accumulated reports since installing OpenVAS, while Results reveal vulnerabilities discovered during scans. For example, you can identify an operating system that has reached its end of life and the affected host system. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial, as outdated systems are unlikely to receive automatic patches. Returning to the Scans menu, we'll examine the Tasks. On the first page of the list, I'll select a specific report, focusing on a task that scanned IP addresses ending with \"100,\" including a vulnerable host called Metasploitable. I'll click on the report and head to the Results tab to view the issues detected by OpenVAS. These issues range from passwordless logins to an end-of-life operating system and a VNC brute force login vulnerability. Expanding on a particular point provides detailed information and suggests solutions. Under the Scan menu, there's an extensive list of menu items, including Assets, Configuration, and more. Assets allow you to view scanned hosts, while Configuration lets you create targets and credentials. Lastly, the Administration and Help sections provide access to administration tasks and helpful resources. This concludes our demonstration. We explored Greenbone's Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner, also known simply as OpenVAS.",
