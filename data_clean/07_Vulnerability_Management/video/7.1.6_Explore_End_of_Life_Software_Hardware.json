This normally means there's a new version already out or going to be released, where developers will focus on the new version of the software versus the old. We're going to explore some ways to keep track of the end-of-life. One good way to keep track of this is by finding information on the internet. When a piece of software will no longer be supported, the date will be published so tech administrators will know when an update is needed. One website we can check out is endoflife.date. As you can see, all sorts of different software companies are listed. Some of the most popular pages are listed here in the middle. Let's take a look at Windows Server. After scrolling down, we can see that Windows Server 2012 R2 will reach the end-of-life starting on October 10, 2023. Although this version of Windows Server hasn't received full support since 2018, it has been getting regular security updates. If a software isn't receiving security updates, it could leave you vulnerable to hackers. That's why, in most cases, software will be listed as end-of-life when it no longer receives any updates. Now, the last window is what they call extended security updates. Usually, this involves paying a substantial amount of money to receive updates past the normal security support date. Once the extended date is reached, there are typically no more updates to that version of the software. Let's look at one more example. Red Hat Enterprise Linux goes through a similar phase. There comes a time when full support isn't available. Full Support may entail bug fixes and features, while Maintenance Support typically includes security updates and some bug fixes. RHEL 7 will reach the end-of-life starting on June 30th, 2024. There's also an Extended Life Cycle Support up through June 30th, 2028. If you work in the tech industry, you should always be aware of the end-of-life dates set by the software you manage. Another way to be informed about end-of-life software on your network is to scan your computers. Network scanners can scan computers and find what software may be installed on them. Here, you can see that the CentOS 6.9 server is a device that was scanned on our network; however, it's at the end-of-life since it's not supported by regular maintenance. Instead of going to each computer and looking at a list, this could be helpful. The same concept applies to software. Installed software could also be marked as end-of-life if it's no longer supported. This could mean there's a new version of the software out, or the developer who originally made it abandoned the project. One example is PuTTY. You can see it picked up version 0.79. If this same version were on other systems, you'd see multiple computers listed here. The version that's installed can be used as a comparison to the latest version released by the developer. Knowing what kind of operating systems and software are installed on your network is a significant step in keeping your network secure. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we showed you how to research end-of-life dates and how you can use a network scanner to discover information on your network.",
