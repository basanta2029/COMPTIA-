  "full_content": "Transcript close interactive script Throughout this course, we talk about many scanning methods. Typically, you scan for a specific purpose, often to look for vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning attempts to find points that can be exploited on a computer or network. A vulnerability scan can detect and sometimes classify system weaknesses in computers, networks, and other equipment. The scan can also predict the effectiveness of countermeasures that you might implement. A scan may be performed by an IT department or someone hired to perform a penetration test. There are several good tools that perform vulnerability scanning. But if you're on a budget, you can use nmap with a script, the Nmap Scripting Engine, to do a vulnerability scan. I'm on a Kali Linux system. This system comes with a whole bunch of scripts, but the one we want isn't included. That's not a problem; we can go out to the web and find it. To get the script, we'll go to Github. I've already located the web page with the script. This is the one that we want. I'll open that link. Down here, in the description, it says that the script uses some well-known service to provide information about vulnerabilities. That's really not a great description, but I happen to know that it works pretty well. To get the script, you need to click on this Clone or Download link and copy the address. Now, we'll open the terminal, type in 'git clone', paste in the rest of the address, and press Enter on the keyboard. I've already done that, so I won't do it again. When I was doing this, I wasn't paying attention, and it went into the root directory, so I had to go in and move it to the /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory so nmap knows where to find it by default. If you have some basic Linux skills, it shouldn't be a problem to move to the directory before downloading the script. All right. On my network, I have a Windows 10 system, and I've installed XAMPP on it with some web pages, php, forms, and so on. I want to put it out there facing the public internet. But I'm not sure if it has any vulnerabilities. This is my example. I could also have other systems that I can scan. But for this demo, I'm just going to scan this particular system. Since I'm familiar with this system, I already know the IP address. To begin, I want to just do a regular service scan with nmap to see what we get. For that, I'll type in 'nmap -sV 10.10.10.195' and press Enter. It takes a few seconds to get the results. When it's done, you can see that I have a few open ports and services running. As I already mentioned, this system is running a web server, Apache, along with other services, so I'm concerned about it. Now let's run this scan with the script. To run the script, we'll type 'nmap - -script nmap-vulners -sV 10.10.10.195' and press Enter. This will take a few seconds. The scan is done. Now we have some additional information. Right here, we have some information under Apache and port 443. I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click on this hyperlink. It'll open Firefox, and I'll go to the page where I can read more about this particular vulnerability. I'll scroll down. Under the description, it tells me exactly what this issue is. It looks like someone could execute some code, so it's probably not something I want to let loose on the web until I do more research and fix any problems. While we're in Firefox, let's jump back over to the Github tab. I'll go back a page. There are other scripts here that do some additional scans. If you have a test environment (and you should), you can download others and see what type of results you can get. Remember that you can run multiple scripts in one scan. That's it for this demo. In this demo, we used nmap and the Nmap Scripting Engine to do a vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 system running XAMPP. First, we went to Github to locate the scripts we needed. Then we did a regular service scan with nmap. We did another scan using the script, and then we used the web to learn more about one of the vulnerabilities that the script found.",
