It involves scanning the target system for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or security loopholes that could be exploited by attackers. Vulnerability scans are performed internally and externally to inventory vulnerabilities from different network viewpoints. Vulnerabilities identified during scanning are then classified and prioritized for remediation by security operations teams. A network vulnerability scanner, such as Tenable Nessus or OpenVAS, is designed to test network hosts, including client PCs, mobile devices, servers, routers, and switches. It performs three primary functions: discovery, assessment, and prioritization. During discovery, it examines an organization's on-premises systems, applications, and devices. It then assesses the scan results, comparing them to configuration templates and lists of known vulnerabilities. Typical results from a vulnerability assessment will identify missing patches, deviations from baseline configuration templates, and other related vulnerabilities. The tool compiles a report about each vulnerability. Each identified vulnerability is categorized and prioritized using an assigned impact warning. Most tools also suggest remediation techniques. This information is highly sensitive, so using these tools and distributing the reports produced should be restricted to authorized hosts and user accounts. Credentialed and non-credentialed scans are two different approaches to conducting vulnerability scans. A credentialed scan, also known as an authenticated scan, requires the scanning tool to provide valid credentials to access the target system. This allows the scan to gather more comprehensive information about the system's configuration, installed software, and other details that may not be accessible without proper authentication. In contrast, non-credentialed scans, also known as unauthenticated scans, don't require credentials to access the target system. Instead, it relies on external scanning techniques to probe for vulnerabilities and potential security issues. Both types of scans have their own advantages and limitations. Credentialed scans offer a more accurate assessment of vulnerabilities but require privileged access to the target system. On the other hand, non-credentialed scans can be performed remotely and quickly, making them suitable for high-level assessments or initial security checks. However, they generally provide a less detailed view of the system's security posture compared to the credentialed scans. Similarly, application vulnerability scanning describes a specialized method for identifying software application weaknesses. This includes static analysis and dynamic analysis. Static analysis involves reviewing application code without executing it. It involves examining the code for potential vulnerabilities, bugs, coding standards violations, and other issues that could impact the security, performance, or maintainability of the software. Dynamic analysis involves executing a program and observing its behavior in real-time. It also tests running applications that can identify issues like unvalidated inputs, broken access controls, and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Another critical capability in application vulnerability assessment practices includes package monitoring. Package monitoring is the practice of tracking and monitoring software packages or dependencies used in an application. It involves keeping a close watch on the versions, vulnerabilities, and updates of these packages to ensure the security and integrity of the application. Modern applications often rely on third-party libraries, frameworks, or modules that provide pre-built functionalities. These packages can introduce vulnerabilities if they contain outdated or insecure components. Package monitoring helps identify such vulnerabilities and allows developers to take appropriate actions to mitigate potential risks. That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed vulnerability scanning. We looked at the three stages of network vulnerability scanning. We also looked at credentialed and non-credentialed scans. We talked about application vulnerability scanning and package monitoring—methods used to enhance the overall security posture of an organization's software.",
