As you probably know, Linux is a very popular platform for testing network and host security. First, you need to choose a Linux distribution that you can use for penetration testing. A good place to start looking for those distributions is the DistroWatch website. Many of the Linux distributions here can be run as a live CD or installed on the hard drive. A live CD is an optical disc or a bootable USB drive that has the Linux operating system installed on it. It can also have many of the security tools you need to perform a penetration test. Because it's installed on a USB drive or an optical disc, you can insert that into the computer and boot the system off the disc. When you do, you'll have a Linux operating system up and running with the tools you need for testing. There are several advantages associated with testing this way. First, there's a wide variety of free penetration testing tools available for the Linux operating system, and if you're using a LiveCD, you don't have to install an operating system. If you're booting off an optical disc, there's no way for malware or anything else to actually affect the files on the disc. There are many different distributions available. You can see their names here. You can also see the purpose of the distribution listed over here. Since we're interested in security, let's go over here and look at this one. The most popular and well-accepted distribution for security and penetration testing is Kali Linux. Let's go ahead and click on that and see what we can learn. It tells us where the home page is and a lot of other information. I have its home page open in another tab, up here. We can read a little bit more and see what tools are actually included on this distribution. I'm going to go to the Download page. I see the latest version right here, Kali Linux 64-Bit. Over here, I can see the checksum, or hash value. Now, I already have a copy of Kali downloaded and ready to go. We'll get to that in a minute. But I want to go back to DistroWatch. I'll go back to the previous page. I just want to point out that there's another Linux distribution called Parrot Linux. Parrot is a distribution with a collection of various utilities that are popular with penetration testers and computer forensic professionals. Here's the link to the home page, but I already have a tab opened up. Down here, you can read more about the project and learn about the different tools. Now back to Linux. My Kali Linux ISO image is downloaded, and I've booted it up. Now it's asking me now if I want to install it to disc or just use it as a LiveCD. I'll go ahead and say, \"Sure, go ahead and just use it as a LiveCD.\" We'll let it launch, and pretty soon, we'll see the graph called User Interface. Each Linux distribution has its own set of package tools. This one specializes in security tools. Here are some of the tools that Kali Linux has packaged with its distribution. Over here, you'll see the Metasploit Framework Armitage (which is a graphical user interface for that framework), Burp Suite, BeEF Cross-Site Scripting Framework, and some others that we could use to do our penetration testing. Now, obviously, we don't have time in this short video to really discuss penetration testing or even look at a specific tool in-depth, but I'll show you how you could penetration test using one of the pre-packaged tools that we can launch from a LiveCD. Let's start the Metasploit Framework by clicking on it. That's going to create the database where we're going to save some of the information about hosts and other things. Once that's done, I'll go ahead and bring up Armitage, which is the graphical user interface that we can use to easily interact with the extensive commands that exist as part of the Metasploit framework. It looks like that's launched now, and we'll go ahead and launch Armitage. There it is. We'll connect, and it asks us if we want to start the remote procedure called Server. We'll say, \"Sure, that'll be great. It'll connect us up to the database.\" It takes just a minute to make those connections. It looks like it made the connection, and it'll launch here shortly. We're greeted with several different windows and several different options. Essentially, what we need to do is tell Armitage (and, in conjunction, the Metasploit Framework) which hosts we want to actually try to launch an attack on. We could use an Nmap scan to import that information. We could also use the Metasploit Framework scan, which will go out and ping the different machines in a certain subnet and gather information. In this case, I'm going to keep it simple so we don't scan all the hosts on our network, and I'll just add a single host, a vulnerable Linux virtual machine that I have on the network. I know it's on the IP ending in .102. Now click Add and then OK. It says that it added it, and we've identified a host. However, we don't have much information about it yet. But if I right-click on that host, I can scan it. Now it'll look for all the open ports, and you can see a variety of open ports that are coming up. We can also request additional information about services that might be running and on specific ports. So you can see here that we have certain ports, but we don't know much about the services quite yet. If we wanted to, we could try to gather some additional information. Let's do an MSF scan on that host, and that will try to identify some information about the operating system that's running on it. You'll notice that every time we run a command it launches a separate window down here, so you could go along and close these out as you go. We know some information about this computer--some of the ports that are open, some of the services that may be running, etc. It's not a lot of data, but Metasploit keeps track of the vulnerabilities based on the ports that are open, the services that are running, the operating system that's running, and so on. You can come up here, and you can actually find attacks specific to the host that you've already discovered. We'll let it go through its database and find specific exploits that it might want to try. So, that's complete. Now we could go through the attack menu and look for a specific exploit. You'll see here that, based on the ports that it found, it said, \"Hey, FTP's open. Go ahead and try these exploits.\" Each of these exploits will run the specific exploit when you click on them, and you have to provide specific values for the exploit. We don't actually know if any of these attacks will run, so the ability to check on that is built into the Metasploit framework. Some of the exploits have the ability to use this check; others are older and don't. Let's try doing a check on some of these right now. It says this one doesn't support the check, this specific vulnerability is not exploitable, not exploitable, doesn't support the check, and so on. For the ones that don't support the check, we'd have to go through and try each of them individually. Now, generally, as you're looking at an organization and trying to compromise hosts within it, you don't want to make a lot of noise or cause a lot of traffic on the network, so you try these very specific attacks based on what you discover. However, there is an option inside of Armitage (and, subsequently, Metasploit) that lets you do what's known as the Hail Mary, and that is just try out every single attachment possible. In the interest of time, rather than going through every single one of these attacks in a systematic way, we'll do the noisy attack because I want to show you how you can compromise the mission, and we'll see which vulnerabilities actually exist. If we click on Hail Mary here, then it says, \"Hey, are you sure you want to do this? There's going to be a flood of exploits, and it's kind of noisy. We'll say yes, that's what we intend to do, and then it'll go through that database of exploits and try to run them with a variety of different payloads so that it's trying to establish a connection to that remote machine. We'll let it do its thing here for a minute. It went through the database, and now it's launching each of those exploits. You'll see that the exploits are going to certain ports based on the services that are running on those. We'll give it another minute here, and it'll start taking advantage of some of those exploits. Oh look, our icon changed. That means we actually have a connection. And once it made the connection, it gathered some additional information and says, \"Yep, this is definitely a Linux box.\" We can see what version of Linux and some other information, too. Once we have a session, we can gather all sorts of data. We can get the dump of the passwords and the hashes associated with the passwords and then try to crack those. Maybe we compromise the accounts and get more straightforward access, but there's all of these different sessions that we could establish based on the different exploits that we just ran. Again, usually, you wouldn't do the Hail Mary because it's too noisy. But in this case, it's a quick and easy demonstration of the vulnerabilities that exist on this specific machine. If we scroll down here, we'll see a variety of exploits that exist for this machine, and we'll give ourselves a little bit more space. You can see, as we scroll up, that it looks like there's a PHP exploit, PHP CGI injection. There's a user map, a Samba exploit, another Samba exploit, and several others that actually allowed us to have a session over to that machine. Let's go ahead and open a new console session. I'll adjust these windows so we can see better. We can run the sessions command, and you'll see that we currently have four sessions connecting from our machine. I know that's this IP address to this vulnerable machine, right there, through PHP, and then through some command lines. Let me go ahead and connect to one of these sessions interactively. We'll choose Session 2, and now I've got a Linux command prompt. I can do things like list the file system. I can say, \"Who am I?\" If you look at the bottom here, I have root access. With that access, I could grab the hashes for the passwords. I could execute any commands. I could set up additional back doors. I could do all sorts of things. Penetration testing is awesome, and ultimately, we're trying to compromise systems so that we know how to lock them down. To do that, we often use these pre-packaged tools that come with the distribution. Kali Linux along with Metasploit and Armitage already pre-packaged is a fantastic tool to use for penetration testing. That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we talked about penetration testing tools, and then we talked about the concept of a LiveCD and looked at a couple of Linux distributions that you could download and use in your testing.",

I'll adjust these windows so we can see better. We can run the sessions command, and you'll see that we currently have four sessions connecting from our machine. I know that's this IP address to this vulnerable machine, right there, through PHP, and then through some command lines. Let me go ahead and connect to one of these sessions interactively. We'll choose Session 2, and now I've got a Linux command prompt. I can do things like list the file system. I can say, \"Who am I?\" If you look at the bottom here, I have root access. With that access, I could grab the hashes for the passwords. I could execute any commands. I could set up additional back doors. I could do all sorts of things.",
      "summary": "In this section of the CompTIA Security+ course, learners explore the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in a Linux system, gaining access to sensitive information such as password hashes. The demonstration highlights various exploits, including PHP CGI injection and Samba vulnerabilities, allowing for multiple session connections to the compromised machine. Practical applications include executing commands, retrieving password data, and establishing backdoors, emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating such security risks.",

To do that, we often use these pre-packaged tools that come with the distribution. Kali Linux along with Metasploit and Armitage already pre-packaged is a fantastic tool to use for penetration testing. That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we talked about penetration testing tools, and then we talked about the concept of a LiveCD and looked at a couple of Linux distributions that you could download and use in your testing.",
