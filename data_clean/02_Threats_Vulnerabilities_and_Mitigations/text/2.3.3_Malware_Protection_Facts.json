Some malware attempts to hide itself or can provide a remote attacker control of the computer system. Malware prevention Malware recovery Malware Prevention Regardless of the type of malware, there are some common things you can do to prevent malware infection: Option Description Patches As corporations find errors, they regularly release them in updates and patches. Ensure that you are at the current version of the following: Hardware Firmware Updates Server and Client Operating Systems Applications, especially your web browser Malware protection software Anti-malware Install antivirus or anti-malware software to protect against known infections. Consider the following: Choose anti-malware software from a reputable company. Do not let scareware fool you into purchasing a product that may not work or is actually a virus. Keep definition files up-to-date. Enable antivirus scanning for email attachments. Enable scanning of files downloaded from the internet. Enable antivirus scanning for all removable storage, such as USB flash drives and CD-ROMs. Schedule regular scans. Browser Settings Enable a pop-up blocker. Enable privacy controls. Monitor and manage cookies. Regularly clear the cache/history. Disable or configure Autocomplete settings not to store sensitive information. Firewall\tModern operating systems include a local firewall. This will help protect against unauthorized connections to the local host and attempts by malicious software to make outgoing connections to command and control servers. Training Examine and email attachments for incorrect file extensions and confirm with the sender what they sent if possible. If pop-ups occur for unknown software, ask to install a new antivirus or more; do not accept and exit the dialog. Then contact IT. Do not use social media at work where malicious links could cause the work computer to be infected. Hover over all links to verify that the target URL is valid. Do not use any devices that they find lying around the office. Only use reputable software approved by the organization. Web Filter\tIf there is a need to have additional control, consider installing a web filter. This provides the ability to block access to malicious sites that users might be visiting regularly. Malware Recovery Malware can permanently damage your system. Recovery from malware can include the following steps: Remediate problems as prompted. Remediation is the process of correcting problems. Most antivirus software remediates problems automatically or semi-automatically by prompting you to identify the action to take. Possible actions in response to problems are: Repair the infection. Repair is possible for true viruses that have attached themselves to valid files. During the repair, the virus is removed, and the file is placed back in its original state when possible. Quarantine the file. Quarantine moves the infected file to a secure folder where it cannot open or run normally. You might quarantine an infected file that cannot be repaired to see if another tool or utility can recover the file at another time. Delete the file. You should delete malicious files such as worms, Trojan horse programs, spyware, or adware programs. Periodically review the quarantine folder and delete any files you do not want to recover. Reinstall applications or features. Re-image a machine if your organization uses imaging solutions. Re-imaging or installing from scratch is often faster and more effective than malware removal and cleanup. If an image is not available, reinstall the operating system.",
