  "full_content": "Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's consent or knowledge. It often attempts to hide itself. And some malware even takes control of the computer system. There's a long list of malware types. I'm going to tell you about just a few of them. First, let me introduce you to worms. A worm propagates without a file. It travels across computer networks without any user assistance, and it automatically replicates itself. Worms are one of the deadliest malware types because they can quickly spread to millions of computers. They usually take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in computer systems. To avoid a worm infection, keep your systems patched. Next, there's the Trojan. The Trojan virus is named after the Trojan horse in Greek mythology. It seems benign, but it's not. It usually comes in the form of a useful application hiding malicious code. It may be explicit or run invisibly. Trojans don't self-replicate like worms, and they aren't attached to a file like a virus. But they can create back doors for an attacker, allowing remote control of the infected machine. The Remote Access Trojan, or RAT, is a common virus. A RAT is designed to give the attacker remote desktop access, including a GUI. It gives the hacker complete control over the system and allows them to view all communications, webcam footage, files, and emails. Since a RAT requires the hacker to connect to the user through a port that isn't commonly used for internet access, if the user is behind a firewall, this often prevents the hacker from connecting. If the hacker can get around the firewall and open that port, then they're able connect. Next, there are rootkits. This malicious software hides in the system and alters the system's processes and registry entries. A rootkit is almost invisible. It resides below antivirus software detection. This makes it difficult to detect and very dangerous. Special Anti-rootkit software can help detect rootkits. Let's move on to the logic bomb. This is a piece of malicious code designed to execute only under pre-defined conditions. It'll lay dormant until the pre-defined condition is met, such as a certain time or date. Logic bombs can range from benign, such as pranks, to dangerous, such as driver formatters. One example is a piece of code that lies dormant until it executes once per year, perhaps on someone's birthday. Another example is a user opening a certain program that activates it, deleting the contents of disk drives. Next is spyware. This is computer software installed without the user's consent or knowledge. It's designed to intercept data or take partial control of the user's computer. Spyware often collects personal information about the user, like internet surfing habits and passwords. It uses tracking cookies to collect information about the user's activities and report it to the hacker. It can also interfere with a user's control in other ways, such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting web browsers. An important malware to know is ransomware. It allows a hacker to gain access to a system, plant a virus that encrypts all user data, and then demand a payment for decrypting the data. If the victim doesn't pay, the hacker threatens to destroy the data. But there's no guarantee that the hacker will actually send the decryption key once the victim's paid for it. There's also no guarantee that the victim will pay the ransom. If they have a backup still intact, they may choose not to pay. Because of this, ransomware is becoming less prevalent and cryptomalware is gaining popularity. The difference between ransomware and cryptomalware is that crypto operates quietly in the background and keeps going indefinitely until it's noticed. This is called cryptomining. Mining cryptocurrency wears down a system substantially. It eats up bandwidth and processing power, which slows the system down and affects productivity. If it goes on long enough it can even cause graphic cards to die, processors to burn out, and memory to act unpredictably. Another interesting malware is the fileless virus. It uses legitimate programs to infect a computer. Because it doesn't rely on files, it leaves no footprint, making it undetectable by most antivirus, whitelisting, and other traditional endpoint security solutions. Fileless malware isn't a traditional virus, but it works in a similar way by operating in memory. It never even touches the hard drive. Many hackers use social engineering to get users to click on a link in a phishing email. When the web page opens, the virus gets into the inner recesses of a trusted application such as PowerShell or Windows script host executables. Now let's talk about how you can prevent falling victim to malicious software. First, use the latest version and patch level for your web browser. Then install the latest patches for your operating system. You should also install antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, and personal firewall software. On all anti-malware software, be sure to keep your definitions up to date for the latest threats. Use a pop-up blocker to prevent adware. Use software to control cookies on your system. Schedule regular scans to constantly detect malware. If a scan does detect malware, quarantine or delete the malicious software. Malware may cause permanent damage to the system. Even though anti-malware software can scan, detect, and delete malware for you, the system may still need repairs. You might have to reinstall applications or even reinstall the entire operating system. Many companies image their operating systems, so if malware is detected, they'll simply send down a brand new image that overrides the entire operating system. All right, that's it for this lesson. In this video, we talked about different types of malware and how they work. We also learned how to prevent and repair malware in case your system or network becomes infected.",
