  "full_content": "In this demonstration, we're going look at the Windows Security app. In previous versions of Windows, this was known as Windows Defender or Windows Defender Security Center. Either way, its functionality as Windows' default anti-malware software still remains the same. The name of the anti-malware software that's controlled by this app has also been renamed. It's called Microsoft Defender now. Let's delve into the Windows Security app a little more. Let's come down here, type Security, and click the Windows Security app to open it. When you start the app up, you'll see Security at a glance. They've divided the whole thing into smaller subsections for easier navigation, like Virus & threat protection, Account protection, Firewall & network protection, and so on. If you look at the bottom-right corner of each category icon, you'll see a green checkmark that indicates that each section is currently providing protection. If, on the other hand, you see a yellow exclamation point triangle on the icon, that indicates that something might be amiss. And if you see a red X here, it means that something needs your immediate attention. Okay, let's take a closer look at Virus & threat protection. As I mentioned before, the green checkmark tells us that no action is needed at this moment. But let's click it to take a closer look anyway. Virus & threat protection is what Windows Defender used to be—it takes a thorough look at your computer system and checks for things that might be concerning. Here, we can look at Current threats, Protection settings, Protection updates, and Ransomware protection. Under Current threats, we see the last time the system was scanned, how many threats were found, and how many files were scanned as well. By default, Microsoft Defender scans your system on a regular basis. But if you're concerned that some type of malware may have gotten into your system and you don't want to wait until the next scheduled scan, you can manually scan the system whenever you like by clicking Quick scan. You can change Scan options as well. Notice that you have four options for running a manual scan. The first one is the Quick scan I mentioned, which checks your system in places where threats are commonly found. A Full scan checks every file on the system. The disadvantage of full scans, obviously, is that they take a lot longer. The third option would be to run a Custom scan to check specific files and folders. The last option is a Microsoft Defender Offline scan. This one takes about 15 minutes and restarts the system as part of the routine. If you run a scan and do find malware, it means that your system is already infected and needs to be remediated. Obviously, it's much better to try to detect malware before it infects your system, say, as you're downloading a file from a malicious website. That's where Real-time protection comes in. Instead of just scanning for malicious files on your hard disk drives, Real-time protection watches what you're doing and tries to detect malware as it enters the system. To turn on Real-time protection, let's come down here, to Virus & threat protection settings. Notice that it tells us that Real-time protection is currently turned on. Understand that with this software, there are a few different ways to utilize the protection options. One is to generically scan files for characteristics that might indicate that that file is either malware or contains malware of some sort. There's also Cloud-delivered protection, which sends information to Microsoft that allows them to update their definition files and get them out faster. We'll talk about definition files shortly. You also have the option to send those malware samples to Microsoft directly. You can also use Tamper Protection, which monitors important security features and prevents them from being changed. Controlled folder access allows further protection for dedicated locations and files on your system. Occasionally, you may need to implement an exclusion. This is any item, file, folder, or process that you want to exclude from being scanned. Take caution when you're adding exclusions, as some excluded items could contain threats that could make your system vulnerable. To add an exclusion, click the Add or remove exclusions link, click the Add an exclusion button, select the type of item to be added, browse to it, and select it. Now let's go back and look at Virus & threat protection updates. First, it's important to know that Windows Security uses files called definitions to help detect threats and protect your system from them. Windows Defender tries to automatically download the latest definitions for you. Under Virus & threat protection updates, it tells us the last time that the system was scanned using definitions. If we click Protection updates, we can see even more information, such as the version, when it was created, and when it was last updated. If we want to manually force an update, we can click Check for updates. Windows Security works reasonably well. However, some folks still prefer to disable it and install a third-party anti-malware package. If you choose this route, remember that before you install the package on your system, you need to make sure that Windows Security is turned off by going to Virus & threat protection and turning Real-time protection off, as we did earlier in this demo. This is important because if you have two anti-malware packages running on your system at the same time, they're likely to conflict. Each will probably think that the other one is a virus. There are some good free anti-malware packages, but keep in mind that you're likely to get better service from a paid package than a free one. But at the end of the day, the important thing is that you protect your computer from malware in some way. That's it for this demonstration on malware. We talked about implementing anti-malware software by looking at the Windows Security app, which comes with Windows by default. Then we took a closer look at the app's features in Virus & threat protection. We also talked briefly about third-party anti-malware packages.",
