The following table provides common examples of these techniques: Technique Description Moral obligation\tAn attacker uses moral obligation and a sense of responsibility to exploit the target’s willingness to be helpful. Innate human trust\tAttackers often exploit a target’s natural tendency to trust others. The attacker wears the right clothes, has the right demeanor, and speaks words and terms the target is familiar with so that the target will comply with requests out of trust. Threatening\tAn attacker may try to intimidate a target with threats to make the target comply with a request. This is especially the case when moral obligation and innate human trust tactics are ineffective. Offering something for very little to nothing\tOffering something for very little to nothing refers to an attacker promising huge rewards if the target is willing to do a very small favor. The small favor can include sharing what the target thinks is a very trivial piece of information for something the attacker offers. Ignorance\tIgnorance means the target is not educated in social engineering tactics and prevention, so the target does not recognize social engineering when it is happening. The attacker knows this and exploits the ignorance. Authority and fear\tAuthority techniques rely on power to get a target to comply without questioning the attacker. The attacker pretends to be a superior with enough power that the target will comply right away without question. The attacker could also pretend to be there in the name of or upon the request of a superior. Authority is often combined with fear. If an authority figure threatens a target with being fired or demoted, the target is more likely to comply without a second thought. Social proof\tWith a social proof technique, the attacker uses social pressure to convince the target that it is okay to share or do something. In this case, the attacker might say, \"If everybody is doing it, then it is okay for you to do it, too.\" Scarcity\tScarcity appeals to the target's greed. If something is in short supply and will not be available, the target is more likely to fall for it. Likeability\tLikeability works well because humans tend to do more to please a person they like as opposed to a person they do not like. Urgency\tTo create a sense of urgency, an attacker fabricates a scenario of distress to convince an individual that action is immediately necessary. Common ground and shared interest\tCommon ground and shared interest work because sharing a hobby, life experience, or problem instantly builds a connection and starts forming trust between two parties. Social Engineering Process The social engineering process can be divided into three main phases: research, development, and exploitation. The following table describes each phase. Phase Description Research\tIn the research phase, the attacker gathers information about the target organization. Attackers use a process called footprinting, which takes advantage of all resources available to gain information. Footprinting includes going through the target organization’s official websites and social media, performing dumpster diving, searching sources for employees’ names, email addresses, and IDs, going through a tour of the organization, and other kinds of onsite observation. Development Selecting individual targets within the organization being attacked. Forming a relationship with the selected targets. Usually, attackers select people who will not only have access to the desired information or object but also show signs of being frustrated, overconfident, arrogant, or somehow easy to extract information from. Once a target is selected, the attacker will start forming a relationship with the target through conversations, emails, shared interests, etc. The relationship helps build the target's trust in the attacker, allowing the target to be comfortable, relaxed, and more willing to help. Exploitation In the exploitation phase, the attacker takes advantage of the relationship with the target and uses the target to extract information, obtain access, or accomplish the attacker’s purposes in some way. Some examples include: Disclosing password and username Introducing the attacker to other personnel, thus providing social credibility for the attacker Inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload into an organization's computer Opening an infected email attachment Exposing trade secrets in a discussion. If the exploitation is successful, the only thing left to do is to wrap things up without raising suspicion. Most attackers tie up loose ends, such as erasing digital footprints and ensuring no items or information are left behind for the target to determine whether an attack has occurred or identify the attacker. A well-planned and smooth exit strategy is the attacker's goal and final act in the exploitation phase.",
